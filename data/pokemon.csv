1	"A question about Scizor..."	"4"	"3"	"20130108"	"coopstar777"	"So, I have a technitian Scizor, but I got tired of breeding for an Adamant, so I settled for Brave. This pulls speed into attack, so I was wondering, because bullet punch always attacks first, speed won't be a problem there, but doesn't metal claw do more attack damage? They're both steel types, so they will both get STAB, but bullet punch only gets 40 power while metal claw has 50. So aside from attacking first, why is bullet punch such a big deal?

11	"My problem with the theory of an 8th eeveelution being announced tomorrow"	"10"	"21"	"20130107"	"Luxyono"	"Well, there seems to be a lot of hints suggesting an 8th eeveelution, and I get that and all, but something doesn't add up. Since when does Pokemon just add a new single Pokemon like this? Wouldn't it have to come in a new generation? Or maybe it would have to be announced alongside the possible Ruby and Sapphire remakes, and then they'd add said eeveelution to the Unova Pokedex? Which makes sense and all because Gen III was the only gen that didn't introduce a new eeveelution excluding Gen V, but then how would trade between the B/W/B2/W2 games and the ruby/sapphire remakes work if there was one Pokemon in the remakes that was not in the other Gen V games? If they announced a new eeveelution that'd be like announcing a new generation of pokemon, but they'd need to announce more than just an eeveelution, right? It just doesn't add up, can someone explain it to me in a way that would make sense? Because I know I'm definitely not right about this. (Reddit has never failed to prove me wrong.)
Really, I just so desperately want this to be R/S remakes, but I would be satisfied if this hole-filled eeveelution theory was accurate too. They could be doing this just to mislead us, and oh god I sound like a conspiracy keanu meme.

"2"	"11"	"20130114"	"AugustFay"	"Initially I thought Fenneken was based on a dog and not a fox, perhaps this is true. The proof supporting this hypothesis being that all the previous fire starters are apparently based on the Chinese zodiac: (in order of generation) dragon, rat, cock, monkey, pig and now the dog. So I think ceasing this historical order would seem to be a tad offbeat by the company. Also the fact that a fire/fox Pokemon already exists, Vulpix. Why have two?
Although, on the other hand, a contradicting argument claiming that Fennekin is a fox could also be proposed by it's given name. In that case ""Fennekin"" is just a ""Fennec"" fox (Genus: Vulpes, Species: Zerda), and that would make Vulpix a Red fox (Genus: Vulpes, Species: Vulpes). So I think there could be room in the Pokemon world for Vulpix and Fennekin to coexist as fire foxes.
I am also officially a geek. 
Status: inconclusive. 
What do you guys think?

However once Gen IV games arrived with both Magmortar and Electrivire I feel as if they ruined the 2 Pokemon evolutionary trees. This is why I am happy with Pokemon only having on evolution or two (not that there is a problem with 3 evolutions). This is also why I don't think that if Tauros, Pinsir, Farfetch'd, or any other single evolution Pokemon do end up getting an evolution in X and Y that it more than likely would ruin their tree. Frankly the only other Pokemon I would be happy to see gain more evolutions in future games is Eevee.

Spamming A when trying to learn or forget a new move - often accidentally deleting a good move like replacing my Charizard's Flamethrower with Cut.
Killing the legendary birds and Mewtwo.
When I tried to withdraw or deposit a pokemon in the Box, I accidentally released it instead, because I couldn't read.
I thought a pokemon was the same type as the ones it could use, so Dragonair was both Flying, Dragon, Electric, Water and so on. I also thought, that Machop and Machoke were Rock/Fighting, but for some reason not Machamp.
With my under leveled team of destruction, I eventually reached the Pokemon League, which I tried acing with my newly caught Zapdos lv. 50, which I by the way used my Master Ball on.
When I got a little older, I used to have more than one attack move at different power levels for different opponents. Like I had a Blastoise with Water Gun for low level opponents, Surf for medium level opponents and Hydro Pump for high level opponents. That way I didn't waste Hydro Pump on lv 10 Geodude.
Feel free to add more.

Mine is Ecruteak city. for one main reason really. I love japanese things, not just pokemon. I do like manga and anime and japanese music and such and Ecruteak looks a lot like Kyoto. I'm unsure if they really did base it off of Kyoto but it's a really pretty city. I also love the Kimono girls(Geisha I believe they're really called) and I just find it very cool even though it's so small. and Bell tower and the burned tower is cool too. :)

One of the things America and France were apart of was the XYZ Affair, in which French Diplomats said they would only stop attacking America's ships if they bribed them. So maybe X and Y will be from France's point of view, and the villains based off of Americans. Eventually there will be Pokemon Z, completing the letters of the XYZ Affair. Discuss what you think.

Also, what would you consider to be the best possible team with no legendaries?
My current team (just finished up Pokemon Tower) is: Charizard, Jolteon, Kingdra, Gardevoir, and Shelgon (gonna eventually be Salamance), and I'm currently debating getting a 6th pokemon (any suggestions as to which one would be appreciated). I like this team because it is balanced enough to handle any type (with the exception of electric, but Shelgon has rock smash which currently is getting the job done, and I always have Gardevoir with psychic). I grinded out enough money to buy thunderbolt for Jolteon.

165	"Sylveon type is obvious!"	"0"	"9"	"20130218"	"NovaFlea"	"Okay, maybe this has been posted but it seems that Sylveon's type is obvious. Jolteon, jolt, electric!
Flareon, flare, fire!
Vaporeon, vapor, water!
Espeon, ESP, phychic!
So the pattern continues, and it follows with obviousness that Sylveon( as I have been pronouncing Sil-veon) follows as silver, a metal, which leads to steel type!
EDIT: I have been quick to sarcasm instead of trying to more clearly underline my thought process and for that I am sorry. Let me try a slightly different angle. 
Sylveon when spoken sounds similar to silver a metal, so I ran with steel as the likely type. This fleshes out a bit more. Yes normal the pattern for the names has been similar or exact spelling of the root word (ie. flare, vapor, ext.). So it would assume that if they went for silver it would be silveon. However, I wouldn't put it past some executive to change the ""I"" to a ""y"" just because the game is the X and Y version. Plus it pretties up the look of the name appealing to the younger crowd,
TL;DR: Sylveon is a creative spelling of Silver and the suffix eon, leading me to believe it is a steel type Pokemon.
TL;DR2: I let my emotions run off and acted like a fool instead of being mature  and am sorry.

It has won me more battles than I can count with its counterpart, a level 86 mothafuckin tank wailord that takes most of the hits for tyranitar and both were raised with no exp boosting from diamond to platinum.

I've heard of a website recently called Pokedit, which supposedly distributes event Pokemon ""legitimately"", through the GTS. My main concern is that the Pokemon is gotten through a non legit way. Are the Pokemon proven to be legit, or are they hacked/cloned? I really don't want to wait 3 years for another one to take place.

Sunkern- Sunkern is actually the weakest of all Pokemon, including Magikarp. 
Donphan- Thought about this from the post bout not knowing what a Donphan was in the original movie. I seriously never see or fight these guys. Theres probably like two guys in all the games with a Donphan.
Beheeyem- Probably too soon for this one but another pretty much unknown. These guys could have some really interesting stories bout them too
Edit: No one on here has mentioned it and I just thought bout this. I think the winner of least known Pokemon would have to be Mothim.

I would like to issue you a challenge, namely, a battle between you and the members of /vp/ (4chan's Pokemon board). Here is our suggestions: The challenge would take place on PokemonShowdown.com due to availability, and the fact that the rules imposed there represent the most healthy and diverse metagame available. In addition, the challenge would take place on the OU tier. This is because the OU tier has the most available Pokemon bar Ubers, but Ubers has the smallest amount of competitively viable selection.
What are your thoughts? How would we proceed? Would each site develop a team, or pick a champion to represent it? When should this happen? What do you suggest?
I realize this goes against reddiquette, but please upvote this post so that more people can see it. (I'm fairly certain you don't get karma for text posts anyway.) I'd like to note in my final paragraph that many people on /vp/ are not in favor of starting this, and thus I do not represent the entirety of that board nor do I intend to.
Thanks for reading.

The Light and Sound idea just seem dumb to me.  I think the idea of light vs dark could have made sense if they'd been introduced together, but that ship has sailed.  And sound?  Just no.
But Magic?  Sure, why not?  The Pokemon universe is pretty damn magical as is.  Lots of Pokemon and moves are magical in nature but get stuck in Psychic or Normal because there really isn't another logical place for them.

459	"My First Shiny [Story and Question Inside]"	"0"	"7"	"20130218"	"Lucaan"	"Here is my shiny Bellsprout. And now onto the story:
I was playing a SoulSilver emulator, leveling my Zubat until he learned bite so I can beat Falkner. Defeated Falkner, got the egg from Elm's assistant, and then headed down Route 32 when the emulator froze. I usually am great at saving every five minutes when playing on emulators, but for some reason I didn't this time. 
So I restarted the emulator (after trying to get the game to unfreeze by clicking every possible button on the keyboard, to no avail), began training my Zubat (again) when I see this beautiful Bellsprout. At first I didn't notice the stars, and was going to start attacking when I saw his colors were different than a normal Bellsprout. I guess the emulator freezing was a blessing in disguise.
Now I have a question: does anybody know how to get this Bellsprout from the emulator to my Pearl or White game?
Edit: I found someone who can send the Pokemon to my White game if I give him my save file. If it works, I will edit my post.
Edit 2: It didn't work, but I am not giving up yet.

It being one of the best presents I have ever got. I start off with Squirtle. My reason, Blastoise has cannons on his back. So I leave Pallet town I catch a few Pokemon here and there. I get to Pewter and I wipe the floor with Brock. Then so on with Misty and Lt. Surge. I am now at Rock Tunnel. I hated that place in Yellow. So I go in thinking was going to be alright... NO! I WASN'T! I was in that hell hole for three days. There were times where I almost broke down and cried. My older brother playing Fire Red sees me struggling and decides to goes ahead laughs at me with his level 80 Charizard (only thing he ever used.). Now I'm frustrated and getting ready to quit it finally happened, I found the light at the end of the tunnel that leads to Lavender Town. It was the happiest I had been in those three dreadful days. Eights steps from walking out something incredible happened. I saw it! I SAW ""IT""! A SHINY GEODUDE! I started screaming my head off. My brother came over to see what happened. I started to panic because he told me my GBA was on red. Now I'm in a hurry to catch this Geodude. I have less than 10 balls. A little more nervous now. I get it down to the reds. Ball after ball I threw at it ""Geodude Broke Free"". I was down to my last 3 pokeballs. I threw another. One shake, two shake, three shake. I caught my first shiny! I then proceed to finish the eight steps out of Rock Tunnel, so I don't have to ever go back. I start saving my game. I still super excited. I still jumping up and down for joy. In the middle of my save reality finally kicked in. My batteries fell out... (My GBA didn'y have a back to it.) My brother and I are now standing there with our jaws wide open. We couldn't believe what happened. I frantically put the batteries in hoping it somehow saved. I was at the beggining of Hell Tunnel. There I did the only thing I could think of doing. I turned my GBA off and cried. I didn't play again for 3 months. To this day I have never encountered another wild shiny Pokemon.
Thanks you guys for reading story. 
P.S Sorry it was long.

Like, I put hundreds of hours into each of them. Then 3rd gen came out, and I didn't have a Gameboy Advance, so I couldn't play it. By the time I got a GBA, I was like 13, and assumed that I was too old to still enjoy Pokemon, so I just never got it. Then I entered high school, and saw how many people actually still played Pokemon. So eventually I got around to getting a DS, and I bought Diamond, and Soul Silver.
Here's my dilemma, Reddit. Pokemon is in it's 5th Gen now, with a 6th Gen just around the corner. I had a hard time getting into 4th Gen, because I had to catch up on not just one but two new generations of Pokemon. Instead of playing and being like ""Oh hey! I recognize that one! Ooh a new one! Cool!"" I'm just like ""Oh. I don't know what you are. Or you. Or you. Or you. Oh, hi Pikachu."" Because of this, I never really got into 4th Gen, or even touched 5th Gen. I really want to get back into the newer games,  but it seems impossible to catch up on the 400-500 new Pokemon that have come onto the scene since Gen 2. How can I catch up?

First: If true there has to a sort of acknowledgement that the Pokemon world is truly vast and is a representation of our world. Meaning that each country/continent/what have you also has its own unique Pokemon and such.
Second: With that being said, and with the growth of the series both in game and outwardly (in terms of technology and connectivity). is it so insane to think that the ultimate goal of this series is now to literally create a virtual Pokemon world overlapping ours? Meaning that I could only catch a certain Pokemon when it detects I am in certain countries and thus international trading has a whole new meaning as well as setting a new and far more reality based Pokemon experience. 
In conclusion: I am excited.

I love just about everything about it. The collecting alone sucks me in. But one thing has always held me back from purely 100% enjoying a Pokemon title since the first generation...
I feel like no matter what Pokemon I have, it's just never good enough. I'll look online and see that for optimal stats it has to be trained a certain way, have an egg move, stave off evolution for a certain move, traded and re-traded, it has to be a certain nature etc etc. 
And even now I'm just discovering EV. I'm having a hard time even deciphering exactly what that is and how to make proper use of it. It's all pretty overwhelming and I feel like I'll stand no chance competing online. 
And I hate this feeling holding me back because I truly love everything else Pokemon has to offer. I have a copy of White 2 and a 3DS XL that I'm in love with, I just wish I could shake this feeling and get back into the wonderful world of Pokemon. 
Any help and advice is greatly appreciated!

The whole reason I thought about making this sub was because I remember when I saw shiny and just killed it instantly. Now I see what I did wrong and would like to share it with the community. But, usually, self posts here get down voted pretty quickly. So I thought, why not just make my own sub? I have looked around and have not seen a sub that is like this. 
Also, I need a CSS guy, Banner/Avatat guy and a Flair guy. If you are pretty good at any of these, please pm me with an example of what you have done on other subs.
So if I may ask again, may you please check out the sub? /r/ShinySobStories

Ok so i have been trying to get a shiny oshawott in pokemon black 2 for a while now and I'm only confused if i am actually doing it right 
I saved right in front of bianca and i usually wait until i battle my ""friend"" until i soft reset. 
Is there any way i can tell if its a shiny? 
like is there really a star next to the pokemon when its in your inventory do i actually have to battle my friend?
or as soon as i get oshawott can i just look in my inventory and see that its shiny? any info on shines would be greatly appreciated and a walkthrough on how to get it would be more than appreciated :) thank you

Moreover going to the Dream World and flying to Japan, USA, or Korea is just for a Hidden Ability Pokemon is just a complete hassle. 
So these two factors lead to my expectation for Generation 6 which I have kept for so long ever since generation 3. 
We need an option to alternate between our Pokemon's ""in game"" ability and ""Hidden Ability"" and also our Pokemon's nature. I got a good idea on how GameFreak and Nintendo can implement such a feature. 
Since the Japanese Logo of Pokemon X and Y contains a DNA helix on them why not we implement genetics to the game. We already have those in the form of IVs but that is not enough. For instance we can manipulate the natures a bit and also abilities.
Enough talking, time to get to the bloody point on how GameFreak and Nintendo can allow players to change their Pokemon Natures and Hidden Abilities as well as secondary abilities. 
This can be done after the player obtains their first badge. Players can fulfill an optional sidequest which allows them to alter their natures. 
The sidequest:
The player battles her rival 7 times in the row, then the rival tells the player that he lost something that his dad gave him. Hence you use the Dowsing Machine to find it, after finding the item he then notifies you that his researcher wants you to test out his prototype machine. This machine then allows players to change the Nature of their Pokemon and unlock their alternate abilities as long their starter is in their party. 
How does that sound fellow Pokemon Redditors? I think GameFreak has a potential feature they can implement.

855	"I'm thinking of making a Pokemon Civilization mod for Civilization V, and I want your help!"	"5"	"2"	"20130318"	"93xjell"	"A few days ago I had the ridiculous (but still hopefully awesome) idea of creating a Pokemon civilization mod for the game Civilization V, with Arceus being the leader. I looked up a guide on how to mod for Civ V, but I am far from coding-savvy, and I'll need your help. I intend to make this a group project with as many contributors as necessary, and if it gets enough support and contributions I could publish it to the Steam Workshop, giving all contributors full credit. I will be posting this in /r/civ as well to try and get any interest there, the topic will be linked asap.
For the time being this will be a discussion post. People can talk about what aspects of modding they are good at, or if they can think of any ideas to make the Pokemon civilization truly balanced within the game. After we get enough people willing to contribute, I will give the go ahead for the project.
Here are a few ideas I had in mind when I thought of the Pokemon civilization:
Leader Arceus's unique attribute would be Multitype. If possible, I want it to be able to copy the attribute of any civilization that it is at war with. If it is at war with multiple civilizations, it will only copy the attribute of the first civ that declared war on it.
I have come up with a list of city names already and put them in coding, in order of demographics/region:
Castelia (Capital), Goldenrod, Lilycove, Hearthome, Celadon, Nimbasa, Violet, Slateport, Jubilife, Saffron, Driftveil, Olivine, Rustboro, Veilstone, Lavender, Opelucid, Ecruteak, Mossdeep, Oreburgh, Cinnabar, Nacrene, Blackthorn, Mauville, Eterna, Fuschia, Striaton, Azalea, Sootopolis, Pastoria, Pewter, Mistralton, Cianwood, Fortree, Sunyshore, Cerulean.
Thinking of a unique unit is very difficult, but the only most likely unit I could use would be a Champion, which would replace the Great General. I can't think of any attributes that would separate him from the Khan though.
My idea for a unique building would be the Pokemon Center. This would replace the hospital, and would heal any unit which is adjacent to the city by +1HP/+10HP per turn. I don't know if this would be game-breaking until it's properly tested, but if you could offer more balanced alternatives, that would be much appreciated.
I would really love to get some custom models and art into the game, but I do not have photoshop, which is required to save artwork into a .dds format. If there is someone who has the required program and can get files into said format, or even wants to make custom art for the mod, that would be really appreciated.
So if you've read all this and are interested in making a contribution to the project, leave a comment!

One of the best things about the Pokemon when I started was how unknown everything was. Exploring the locations and the Pokemon was what got me so into the game. With D/P and B/W there was so much info online before the game came out that there were virtually no surprises. Now I'm not saying nobody post anything about it, because I'm sure some people want to know everything available about the upcoming games. But I want to keep viewing all the wonderful art, comics, and other random stuff this subreddit has and still keep X and Y a surprise. So yea, if possible just a spoiler tag when it has to do with something potentially new about X and Y. Thanks everyone!

914	"Pokemon Gold and Silver, appearance rate of Heracross?"	"1"	"11"	"20130114"	"_Fang"	"So I recently picked up the old Silver again, and it's still great. While passing through Ilex Forest, I got Headbutt. In mountainous areas (such as Route 33, for example), you'll get Spearow, Aipom and Heracross from headbutting trees. However, it's been about a week since, trying for an hour or two a day, and I still haven't seen the elusive Heracross. It seems like its appearance rate is pretty much non-existent.
After scouting the internet, I couldn't find any information on the exact rates of appearance of Pokemon in trees. Time of day doesn't seem to have any influence, but I'm not sure about that either.
Long story short, could any of you folks provide me with Heracross' appearance rates in the original Gold and Silver's headbuttable trees? Thanks!
Note that I'm not asking for specific trees. Experiences vary, there's no one tree where they show up more than average for every player.
UPDATE:
I can confirm GreatThunderOwl's theory, that there only is a max of one ""Heracross tree"" per route. On Route 31, I got no results, but decided to switch trees often. One of the trees gave me a Heracross immediately (welcome to the team, Mike!), and another one after that (Lucinda's going to be traded to a friend of mine). A Spearow, and yet another Heracross appeared. The other trees never had them appear.
tl;dr: Only one tree per route at a time holds Heracross. If a tree has 'em, they're fairly common.

I decided to take a shot at my first ever Nuzlocke run, using a Pokemon Emerald randomizer. I'm not a pokemon professional so I don't have all the pokemon/move sets/etc. memorized. I tend to play the games a certain way, favoring certain pokemon over others, so I thought this would be a fun way to play with random pokemon I wouldn't normally (which is entirely the point of playing a Nuzlocke randomizer).
Interestingly, Nuzleaf was included with my starter options along with Gardevoir and Medicham. I went with Gardevoir since it was the most interesting choice to me. If you're more familiar with the game than I am, you may guess how this quickly went awry.
The first pokemon I ran into after getting the 5 pokeballs was a level 2 dratini. As much as I wanted it, 1 confusion would kill it outright and I couldn't catch it normally. Oh well. The second pokemon was a level 3 Groudon, just to taunt me.
I advanced the storyline along slightly and then ran into a random trainer. No sweat, considering Gardevoir's confusion dominated May's Torchic, right? This trainer had a single pokemon - a Poochyena. My only damaging move, Confusion, could not affect it. I was bested by the first random trainer I ran into and my game came to an end within 10 minutes.
I now have a new found respect for the Nuzlocke challenge run. Time to give it another shot, I guess.

The other card is the one I'm confused about. I have no memory of getting it with anything, and I can't find any info on it online. It's the exact same card, but it's in the style of the ex-series, and it was printed in 2005. Since I have no memory of ever getting this card, I would like to know if anyone from r/Pokemon can help me identify it.

I want to get back into this, but I want to do it the right way. What do you think is path I should take?

Plan two: Buy a 3DS and pick the first non-GBA game.

Emerald (This may be hard, since it's a GBA game.) 
Platinum 
Black/White 
Black/White 2

I really want something to fill my time and I'm not sure which I should do. I genuinely love the Unova Pokemon, the original 151 were made (the #1 Top post in r/pokemon) and so I wanted to make the second gen or the 5th, maybe later I'd make the rest. They won't be the size of pennies and would probably be better crafted (as in with more detail, I know that person didn't mean to make them super detailed). So I need help deciding, Johto or Unova?

I would enjoy Grass/Electric, Fire/Poison, and Water/Bug.
Alternatively, give all three a secondary Ghost typing. It would have to go with the theme of the game though.

But Nuzlocke questions and other things should be on the subreddit. 
I also think that shinies are welcome in this subreddit they are nice to see and it makes you feel happy for the other person. But however I think that posts of soft resetted shinies are dumb. You know that you will get one it just depends on how long it will take you out of the 8192 attempts. 
This is an alt account that i will never use again. I love this subreddit and these are just some ideas that i came up with feel free to comment your other ideas and if this gets downvoted to hell i hope the first 3-5 people that see it at least understand where im coming from.

1042	"Who is Your Favorite Trainer of Each Type?"	"0"	"9"	"20130618"	"jklantern"	"So, a little while ago someone posted a thread asking about our favorite Mon of each type.  Well, what would the game be without exciting trainers for us to face as well?  And I'm not just talking Gym Leaders and Elite Four, either.  If Bug Catcher Dave is your favorite Bug Trainer, more power to ya!  
My favorites in no particular order:
Normal:  Norman (Mostly because his team has a big F-Off Ape.)
Water:  Crasher Wake (Most water trainers had either been associated with class and grace or had been a swimmer of some kind before Gen IV.  Wake beautifully subverts that in a level of sheer hammery that BRIAN BLESSED would be proud of.)
Grass:  I'm gonna go with Erika, by virtue of the fact that her narcolepsy amuses me greatly.
Electric:  I'm going to go with Volkner, although I greatly enjoy ALL the Electric type trainers.  The type seems to lend itself well to cuckoocloudlanders.  And don't tell me Surge isn't, the whole conversation about, ""Yay!  You brought my favorite Pokemon"" shows he's a little goofy himself.
Fire:  Blaine (He's the Riddler!)
Ice:  Brycen (He's Bruce Lee!  Also, Beartic is awesome.  What with being a bear and all.)
Flying:  Winona (I like her hat.)
Rock:  Roark (Hey, I like dinosaurs, okay?)
Fighting:  Chuck (No matter how badass you are, relationships are a two way street.  That is what we learn from Chuck.  Also, POLIWRATH!)
Psychic:  Lucian  (I read too much.)
Poison:  Koga  (I remember how awesome it was suddenly seeing him at the Elite Four.)
Ground:  Clay (I live in Oklahoma.  Therefore I find him hilarious.)
Ghost:  Fantina  (Much like Crasher Wake, subverts our expectations.  Phoebe, Agatha, and Morty had kinda been mystics.  And then in walks Fantina...)
Bug:  Burgh.  Unless you count Alder, who I don't personally count as a bug trainer, but hey, I'm not stopping you from doing so.
Dragon:  Drayden.  (Old enough to be your grandfather and STILL more than capable of beating the crap out of you.)
Dark:  Grimsley, mostly because I like Bisharp, although I enjoy the Gambler vibe we get from him.
Steel:  Byron.  (Bastiodon is awesome, and Canalave City is awesome.)

There are a couple more things I'd like to see but I want to see what everyone else has to say!

We were downstairs with another friend watching the other TV because it was crowded upstairs when my 8 year old cousin asked if I wanted to play wii with him. Not really being into football I said sure! I decided to pick the Pokemon trainer because its Pokemon duh! The first Pokemon sent out was ivysaur. My cousin not being old enough to know who that is whether or not he watches Pokemon, asked who I was. I said ivysaur and my girlfriend started repeating that in a funny voice. I thought she was disrespecting so I said ""hey don't be hating! ""  then she said I wasn't that's what he says right?  I was all"" you like Pokemon?!?! "" then she said yep!  I never loved her more than that moment right there.

Offensively, Poison type moves are pretty bad. With five types resisting it and only one weak against it, Poison Pokemon might as well not even learn poison moves besides possibly Toxic or Toxic Spikes. If one ore two more types were weak against Poison, maybe we could salvage this move typing. Perhaps Fighting because a poisoned body isn't good at fighting, or water because it is contaminated and polluted?
As for Ice, Ice typing is usually a death sentence defensively. It only resists itself and is weak against fire, fighting, steel and rock. Almost every pokemon can learn a move of one of those types, so ice pokemon have no real advantage when taking hits. Ice should be fragile, but a resistance to water or grass would make sense. Maybe even Dragon, although that would be harder to justify.
Anybody else think these types (or the other types) need some remedying? No need to keep things the same if it only holds the game back from being better.

As you cross over the water, you decide to wet a line. On your first cast you feel a weak tug and drag in what feels like limp river weed.
But lo and behold, it's not a weed at all! It's a Feebas! As it struggles, you see that it's throwing off sparks... a shiny. A damn shiny Feebas on your first cast on your first time in Route 119. Not wanting to harm it, you toss a Pokeball at it first thing. Remarkably, it rolls three times and clicks!
In a rush, you scramble through the woods to the nearest PC. You stop into the Weather Center and dig through your boxes until... wham. There it is. And, as if fate had singled you out as the person of the day, you see it has the Pokerus.

1468	"PTSD and Pokemon Battling"	"1"	"2"	"20130311"	"intelliswag"	"This is an addition to the ""Kanto War"" theory. 
As we all know, trainers ""black out"" when they lose a battle. More than that, though, it seems like that black out is also a kind of fugue state - which is how I figure we can explain away their ability to travel any kind of distance to the pokemon center after blacking out...
This made me wonder about the nature of Pokemon, especially given the theory that their parents all died in a war...
So...what if they know that this happened? And, because of that, they try to repress the knowledge, simply to avoid the psychological stress of having to deal with the knowledge that your parents are dead? It makes sense, I think, if you realize that these kids have one defense mechanism that helps them to do this:
Their pokemon. 
That's right, what if their pokemon are all just mental representations/defense mechanisms - so when their pokemon all ""faint"" there's nothing left to help the trainers repress knowledge of their parents' deaths? 
It could also account for language differences (pokemon ""faint"" while their trainers ""black out"")...and for the need to acquire more pokemon. 
This also would mean that we could have another explanation for why Professor Oak - who's supposed to be a world-renowned researcher - has no data on Pokemon, and sends you out to go get as many as you can, and raise them to be stronger. 
Thoughts?

For those who don't know, you get up to 10 play coins a day by walking around with your 3ds on. They've been used in other games for things, such as Pokemon Rumble Blast to unlock customers to come to the shop (to get rare pokemon faster) and in Pokemon Dream Radar to maximize the amount of clouds you get.
Because of this I'm thinking they'll be a play coin system in place for X/Y... Personally, I'm hoping for an exchange to get a pokemon not normally found in your game. But, knowing the big N, they'll probably be a pool of pokemon you can get randomly, and it'll be something like:

16 general random ones
2 version exclusives (one from each)
1 Play-coin only pokemon
1 mega-rare but not legendary, like a Volcarona

Anyway that's my thought. SPECULATE!

I've never been a launch day buyer, having always preferred to wait a few weeks, see what the general consensus is on the two versions, and then make a decision. I feel like this is too good a deal to pass up though - I'll get a new game right now, I'll save fifteen dollars, and in October I'll have the feeling of getting a new game without paying for it, having paid in July. I've also never had any traditions in picking a version, and just always picked whichever one seemed the most appealing - but I don't know anything for sure about the differences between the two, and this offer expires in five days. 
So, anybody? Anything? Also, any suggestions on what other 3DS game I should get? I'm looking at Fire Emblem, Donkey Kong, and Animal Crossing but am definitely open to suggestions.

I loved Silver to death, until it got stolen along with my Gameboy (Advance). I got an SP to fill the void, with Sapphire, then later picked up LeafGreen. My cousin then graciously gave me his FireRed and Gold Versions, but the battery in Gold is dead, so I can't play it at all. I've been playing FireRed and LeafGreen recently, insofar as to complete my Hoenn/National Pokedex in Sapphire. I still miss Silver though, and I have been beginning to wonder if it would be worth it to upgrade to a 3DS XL and get SoulSilver. I'm just not sure if it would be worth the ~$230 to do so. What do you guys think? Should I upgrade to a 3DS?

When i was a kid, i would be extremely mean to other people, especially other kids my age. The one kids i bullied the most was my cousin who's about a year younger than me. I would bite him, scratch, push him, do anything i can to hurt him and just cause i can (i know i was a huge asshole). Despite how i treat him like shit my patents insist that I play with him. Well  one day at his house, i see him reading a book. Being my asshole self i tried to stay shit with him but instead he looked really excited. He comes to me showing his Pokemon pokedex book (the one from the 90s). At first i was weirded out that he's being all excited about these monsters. One by one, he tells me the name and a brief description, making them sound cool as hell. After a few minutes of introduction i got really into it and for the first time ever, we started to get along. He and I would play p Pokemon collaseum all day and at sleepovers we'll trade Pokemon cards. Through Pokemon, we've created a strong bond. Because of him introducing Pokemon to me, I've met other people who have the same like and literally through Pokemon, I got through my awkward cruel stage. He's been my best friend and it's been 15 years since we have gotten along. (Sadly he's not into Pokemon anymore).

This story is supposed to be a fictional, scary, Pokemon story, none of this is true.  One time when i was playing my version of Pokemon white Something strange happened. The sprite of Zekrom Was swapped with the other sprite of Reshiram, Of course, I thought this was normal, not knowing the Title of the game Was the opposite of the legendary, even though it was on the box art, When i battled it everything seemed normal exept for its battle cry, which was a shrill, scratchy fequency. When the cry sounded, my pokemon immidatly fainted. I called out my other pokemon  and when i did that the text box with these words appeared: [Player has no more pokemon, Player whited out!] I was sent to my house, which my mom came to me and said [You almost did It] and then she dissapeared. I was freaked out by then. I checked my pokemon, And where my started pokemon would be, there was a level one Wingull, And nothing else, The wingull had 8 Moves, Which were all hms, So i chose Fly and the map came up, but the only thing on my map was anville town. Normally you couldn't fly there, but i clicked on it and it flew me there, From there, i had landed. I took one step and I encountered a battle, It was a level one wingull. This wingulls call was, (what i later found out), Reshirams' original call. I whited out, and I was sent to a black screen, where i was met with my mother and the text: [You almost did it]. I then saw a battle in which a sprite of my mother in battle, was battling with a level one wingull. The wingull immeditely fainted, but it didn't faint it melted. The then melted wingull sprite Let out a very Shrill, scratchy call,  just like reshiram, The screen then turned black, and my 3ds died.

Rather than the elite 4 do the ORIGINAL pokemon league meaning you go up through a tournament style setting, if you win that, you get the privilege to go up against the E4, and they have EV trained + high level pokemon and they use strategy and can use revives etc. 
I would like to see through X/Y that all 750+ pokemon can be obtained, meaning the old legendaries such as mew, mewtwo, lugia etc. can be found in the game in its own dungeon or cave etc. Meaning you can obtain legally every pokemon in that game. Make certain legendary pokemon event based is fine like they did with genesect etc. 
This has been a feature I loved in yellow, have your pokemon follow you! I don't see why they don't keep it? It's fun, it really doesn't ruin the game, and add the option to keep it on or off. 
I really hope they keep challenge mode on. I can't remember the last time I lost to a random trainer, with full health pokemon. (I used an action replay to start the game with challenge mode) 
Allowing HMs to be over writable, or get rid of the useless ones like cut, strength, rock smash etc. 
Now they did this (kind of) with the dream world (having your friends come to your dream or w/e, but add an online version where you can battle against other people, trade with them etc. PS Vita has done online and offline versions of games such as Ragnarok Odessy & Soul Sacrafice. But this would be great. 
That's all I can think of for now. I'll keep in mind if I can think of anything else.

This red version is very special to him because in those long years he has never once started a new game, and never will. The sad part is that the game is running out of time. When that battery finally calls it quits everything will be lost.
I know it is possible to replace the battery but from what I've heard it will erase the saved data as soon as the battery is disconnected. Does anyone know a way to stop that from happening. I was hoping I could do it by hooking it up to a desperate power source while I transplant the batteries but I need advice on how to do it before I proceed.

A short Pokemon history of mine:

I grew up playing Yellow then ignored all the Pokemon games until B/W came out. 2 years ago I got myself a DSi and had a great time playing through Black, in fact I finished it twice within a couple of months. Then I didn't have time for games so I put Pokemon off until last January when I started my SoulSilver current run ¡V first time playing a Gen II game.
Since January I've only played ~23 hours of SS because the usual Pokemon addiction still hasn't set in. I love all things Pokemon and am super-excited about X/Y coming out but I can't get into SoulSilver at all. Playing it feels like a chore.

Here are the main things that bug me about the game:

Too many things to do.
I know that the majority of people loves how huge HG/SS is and how many things you can do in it (apricorns, Alph ruins, bug catching contest, olympics etc.) but I find them distracting and am not at all interested in doing them. On the other hand, I want a Scyther and I want special Pokeballs and other fancy things, so I either have to play along or purposely miss out on the benefits of the extra activities.
And if I choose to ignore them, they still make orientation among cities and important places confusing. For me at least.
I hate the amount of HMs.
My Feraligatr has become an HM slave over time. Cut, Surf, Waterfall. If he could learn Fly, I'd teach it that, it wouldn't even matter at this point.
You get Fly way too late in the game
I only got Fly around hour 22. Might be my fault but I was playing with no guides and I only arrived in Cianwood City after obtaining 6 badges, and travelling between towns had been ridiculously annoying without Fly.
Fucking Flash.
I hate Flash, everyone does, here you need it several times. I'm not going to teach my lovely Ampharos the same move I made him forget when he was still a Flaafy. No way.
The Pokemon distribution doesn't feel right
Can't elaborate on this much, it just feel weird to me; lots of similar Pokemon in one area, feeling little variety overall.
The in-game trades are weird
The NPCs offer Pokemon normally obtainable in the area, they gift me their Pokemon and later ask me to give them back [explained by LobsterTache]. I don't get it.
Too many of the Gen 2 Pokemon I love have no evolution
¡Kand having them on my team feels like I can do better. Those that have a post-Gen II evolution that I can't have till I've beaten Elite Four are just as bad. Yanma, Aipom, Murkrow, Sneasel, [dismissed by lividd3ad] Shuckle, Delibrid, Smeargle, I love them all and yet my brain tells me they aren't good enough with nothing to evolve to.
The telephone is annoying and worthless
I hate the telephone function, it's utter crap. I gave my phone number to everyone and what do I get? Annoying pointless comments and my mom constantly calling me about having bought something I don't need.
Feeling of underleveledness
After beating 7 gyms all my Pokemon are only around lvl 30 and I experienced no problems beating the gym leaders (except for Whitney, but I hear I'm not alone). I feel like my team does not ""deserve"" facing Elite Four, which might happen soon since I only have one gym left.
Wild Pokemon areas are way too common
There's grass or cave or water everywhere. I can't walk for 10 seconds with no repel without a wild Pokemon popping up. God forbid I'm having an underleveled Pokemon at the top of my party, not even repel helps then.
Only the first Pokemon in the party can follow me
A minor gripe but still.

I know I'm the minority not enjoying the Gen II remakes but is there actually anyone else feeling the same way as I do?
EDIT Scratched a few things that others have cleared up, thanks again!

This was very exciting for me, as it was something I had been asking for for a long time.  All the ""big kids"" at my daycare were playing Red or Blue, and I wanted to be a ""big kid"" too.  Imagine my surprise when I got not only a Pokemon game, but the newer and better version of what they had.  Not only was I overjoyed to finally have a Pokemon game to play, it was the newest and best out at the time.
At first the big kids at my daycare still didn't want anything to do with me, even with my Pokemon game.  I realized that to be accepted by them, I needed to become a true Pokemon master.  So I set off to do what all other kids with the game at the time did; become the very best.  I struggled at first, particularly with the first gym (Pikachu doesn't do too well against Onix, as I'm sure you all know).  Eventually I made it past, and continued to progress through the game, bit by bit.  I played it every chance I got, leveling and evolving my team, defeating Gym Leaders, thwarting Team Rocket, and eventually I was on Victory Road headed toward the Indigo League.  One of the other kids at my daycare noticed, to his surprise, that not only had I made it to Victory Road all by myself, but I was going to make it through without too much trouble.  Battled Moltres, caught it, and then they seemed really impressed.  One particular kid was still unconvinced of my skill, and challenged me to a battle at the next stopping point I made, right before the League.  When our battle started, everyone seemed shocked when my Pikachu's Thunder managed to take out his Charizard in a single hit.  The rest of the battle didn't go so fluently, though.  Eventually it came down to my newly captured Moltres against his Zapdos, each of us on our last Pokemon.  Pretty much anything could have killed his Zapdos at this point, but it was faster and a higher level than my fresh level 50 Moltres, and one Thunderbolt was all it took to end the battle.  I was surprised to find that instead of being ridiculed, everyone was impressed, and after I beat the Elite Four they even helped me complete the Pokedex up to number 150.

Any who
I was a little bit late to Pokemon. My first video game console was a indigo GameBoy Advance. My first Pokemon game was Pokemon Sapphire. But I had been around Pokemon since I was a kid. I watched the show and I watched my friends play it on their GameBoy Colours, and I dreamed of the day I too would become a Pokemon Master. 
And then I got Pokemon Sapphire. And I put that fucker down for no man. I played the shit out of it. When Emerald came out, I saved and scraped together pennies to buy that. I got Fire Red after that. (It was traded to me for Sonic Advance 3 I believe.) And I loved every second. With each new game came new features. Ruby and Sapphire brought double battles, adding a whole new layer of strategy to the game. Fire Red let me play an entire generation I missed out on! Emerald made the little Pokemon Sprites MOVE when you sent them out to battle! THEY FUCKING MOVED! How BADASS is that? (I know Crystal had that too, but I didn't get Crystal until recently.) Not only that, but there was this whole Pokemon amusement park in game! It was like a whole new league to defeat and master! 
After that, of course came Diamond and Pearl. I got a DS and I got Pearl. And holy fuck, what a game. It looked so COOL! It was 3D!¡KKind of. The houses slightly changed position when you walked around them. And then came Platinum! Holy shit dude, the distortion world was some MC Escher shit! Fucking radical! HeartGold SoulSilver were great too! Updated menu interface and graphics, plus Pokemon followed behind you like in Yellow! Only it was any and EVERY pokemon! Shit was SO COOL. Plus there was the poke walker! Everything was so cool!
Then some dick nicked my DSi and I didn't play another Pokemon game.
Until¡K
POKEMON BLACK 2/WHITE 2
HOLYFUCKINGSHITDUDE
This is my favourite pokemon game of all time. Lookit the music and the graffiks and the UUUUUNG. This is a sequel. This is a FUCKING sequel. </Egoraptor>
Seriously though. This game is a masterpiece. It deviates from the formula more than any other main series Pokemon game and it benefits so much from it. It has a connecting storyline to Black/White games. It actually IS a sequel! It has a beautiful combination of 2d sprites on 3d backdrops, and implements it perfectly into Gym puzzles and environments for a very immersive game feel. We now have triple battles as well! 
BUT THATS NOT ALL!
Fully animated pokemon! Its not like two or three frames, either. FULL. ANIMATION. The attention to detail is amazing. It sparks new life and personality into the pokemon themselves, making you feel even more connected to them! Fuck, they even close their eyes when they are afflicted with Sleep! Everything just meshes so well together, resulting in a beautiful game. This is also aided by the seasons system.
This isn't even mentioning the RIDICULOUS difficulty level. This isn't your grandma's pokemon. The AI is smart. As you progress in the game, wild pokemon and trainers alike get stronger way faster. While you only get but so much exp per battle. This makes for some very tense battles, and really forces you to put some work into the game. I get that this is really artificial difficulty. But theres something to be said for a pokemon game being hard.
The funny thing is, I don't even particularly like Gen V. I'm going into this game completely vanilla, save for the starters and the mascots. The pokemon design isn't TERRIBLE. There are a few ones that are kinda neat so far. But the game itself; the gameplay, the mechanics, hell, even the story, is a masterpiece. Best pokemon game so far, in my opinion.
And that's my two cents.

There are quite a few clock based occurrences in the 3rd Gen games, and so far I've compiled a list of pros and cons:
Pros:
¡EPokeRus is infinitely contagious. This is the best thing I've found so far. 
Cons:
¡EBerries don't grow
¡EYou can only receive items once from people who would give you them daily
¡EThere is no secret base sale on the roof of Lilycove Department store
¡EThere is no Mirage Island
¡EThe lottery can only be played once
¡EShoal Cave is forever flooded (and therefore I can't get TM 07, NeverMeltIce, the ingredients for a Shoal Bell, or catch a Snorunt)
¡EEDIT: (Thanks to Grayspence for this addition) Eevee can still evolve from friendship into either Espeon or Umbreon. However, the evolution depends on the time of day you originally set the clock to at the beginning. 
If you can think of any other pros/cons that I didn't already think of (or forgot here), I would be grateful

For a Pokemon game, I've always wanted a Rival who is predetermined to be better than you during the beginning - middle of the game. I want the player to actually think ""I finally want to beat this son of a bitch"" when they see him. His first few battles should not even be slightly winnable, and then he talks shit when he beats you.
I feel like this would make finally beating him towards the end of the game so much more meaningful, as you actually conquered your rival. Blue was cool and all, but you never really had any troubles with him. You just simply beat the hell out of him every single time you saw him, right up to the Elite 4. If you managed to lose, you could just re-load a save. I want your rival to be an actual rival - nearly impossible to beat until you've grown as a trainer and person.

This is a good thing i guess because now i am forced to train more than one pokemon and with xp not being devided equally anymore when switching a pokemon in and out of a battle my other pokemon seem to be leveling up quicker too.
i just thought that this was a nice improvment and makes me earn my wins instead of just picking one pokemon and beating every trainer/gym/league with it by itself and have my other pokemon a good 40 levels below

Within 20 minutes of me, there are 8 Gamestops, 2 Best Buys, 2 Targets, and 3 Wal-marts, none of which have either copy. Most had plenty of copies of Super Mario 64 DS, Mario Kart DS, and other games that are 6+ years old. 
HeartGold and SoulSilver have only been out for barely 3 years, and yet it's nearly impossible to find a copy. I understand Nintendo encourages players to trade between versions, but how can they promote such an act when even some of their more recent Pokemon games are so difficult to find?

One suggestion from me and an example:
Mega Blastoise
Water/Steel
Ability: Heavy Artillery (Moves used by this pokemon don't require it to recharge, eg. Hydro Cannon.)
It's a turtle with cannons on its back.  That seems justification enough to give it the steel type, but it sadly missed out on the gen 2 update Magnemite and crew got.  As for the Ability, same reasoning; Blastoise doesn't sport giant cannons for nothing.  Additionally, removing the recharge for Hydro Cannon, Giga Impact, and Hyper Beam effectively doubles his power output, which doesn't seem out of line for what we know about Mega Forms.

Bulbapedia says that in Gen II, fleeing has a priority of -7, but a level 40 Raikou fled before even my level 60 Electrode could do anything. That's a real fucking problem, because I already used my Master Ball on Suicune (that was before I knew my game was doing this). I'm almost positive this is a glitch because I was able to Mean Look it in previous playthroughs with an underleveled Misdreavus. I seriously can't do anything other than spend up to twenty minutes hunting the fucker down, throw an Ultra Ball at it at full health and no status ailments, have it inebitably break out and flee, and then repeat. I'm really determined to catch this thing because I've never done it before, but there's honestly nothing I can do. I don't want to give up, but it seems like there's no other option. Does anyone know what to do?

This meme has gotten really annoying and people started, not just using the same phrase, but also started to repost the same thing!
I don't know about you but I'm really tired of seeing the same thing on the front page over and over again.
There's probably other threads just like this on, but I had to say this again.

I know this game has been brought up before, but it has not in some time, so I thought I would post to help raise awareness and ask any and all questions of this awesome game!
First, here is the website:
http://pokemondod.com/
And you might get more info from the official PDoD forums:
http://www.pokemondod.com/forum/index.php
Anyway, this game is VERY well made and has very regular updates making the game better all the time! There are tens of thousands of players, if not more and the community is just great :)
If you have any questions about the game, I have logged several hundred hours into it, so I will be happy to answer to the best of my ability.

I'd like to see the Pokemon company or some other organization hide images/statues of every pokemon all over the globe for people to find. The images/statues can also include QR codes so that when you find a hidden pokemon you can take a picture of it and have its information downloaded to a co-oresponding PokeDex App on your phone. The project wouldn't limit itself to one of each pokemon hidden somewhere in the world, but several of each in various locations. However, perhaps different circumstances when concerning legendary Pokemon. Imagine yourself walking down a local running trail and you happen to notice a Pichu painted on the back wall of a building. Snap the picture with QR code, boom, you caught a Pichu. Location: Acorn Trail, Ashville N.C., Back wall of Pizza Shop. Certain types of Pokemon can be hidden in related locations. Ex. An Aron statue chewing on one of the bridges of the city of Pittsburgh (Steel Town), or a Corsola on the Pier of a Beach in Florida or a Zapdos or Electabuzz somewhere near a power plant. Just my idea of something that could be a lot of fun for the Pokemon community.

Gogoat - Seems like it should be a fast and powerful attacker. Also you can ride it!
Clauncher, Looks awesome, and hopefully gets a great evo and good typing
Skrelp, Looks like a disheveled and angry horsea. Would be an awesome Poison/Dragon.
Malamar. For some reason, I really like this guy. Looks like a pissed of Ursula and a Cockatoo.

Now I would also carry around some HM whores, so now I think y'all would realize why I put quotations around the word solo.
So I would enjoy some feedback and advice for what I think would be a kick ass run through.

"53"	"10"	"20130114"	"DChiuch"	"Nintendo registers all [pokemon name].com names, even prior to the Pokemon being officially announced. If you look at the whois information for yveltal.com, fennekin.com, etc, then you can see that they were all registered on December 21 (well ahead of the announcement) with Melbourne IT.
http://whois.domaintools.com/yveltal.com
http://whois.domaintools.com/fennekin.com
These whois services usually offer a reverse IP lookup tool, which I believe would show all other domains registered by the company. domaintools.com shows ""44,447 other sites hosted on this server."", which if you buy a report, you can see the list. From there (I think), it would simply be a case of looking which domains were registered on December 21, and we might get the rest of the Pokemon names?
I'm not sure if there are any free alternatives for reverse IP lookups. Everywhere I look seems to take a fee. Any ideas? It's not worth any of us regular folk to pay $x00 to (possibly) find out some Pokemon names, but perhaps fansite owners would see it as a worthwhile investment to break a big story?

Yveltal: I have always hoped for a legendary bird in the newer games, especially since Gen 4 and Gen 5 were just monster-styled ones. I love its look too, especially the white around its neck, the look of power it has.
Xerneas: I love nature and stags. Xerneas just looks so majestic and beautiful.
So you see this is where I clash. I want Yveltal because bird types are always my favourite, but at the same time I don't like it because it represents power, which I tend to stay away from. I want Xerneas because its so majestic and beautiful, but I don't like its color scheme (blue and such).
Of course their types will be a big decision, and version exclusives, but its so hard for me to pick which I like better. Honestly I will either blind pick or just buy both.

ex : Sableye, Seviper, Zangoose, Mawile, Volbeat, Illumise, Spinda, Torkoal, Luvdisc and alot more, are all single evolutions that could use more evolutions for them. Reason for skipping the remake or not, I think that gen 3s pokemon should have new evolutions for gen 6. 
Or another thought is if they do add many evolutions for gen 3 in gen 6, it will make a fresh experience for a remake of gen 3 after gen 6 because there will be alot of new evolutions for it instead than the same game just in 3D.

I run around the day care on my Black and White games until I have 6 eggs of each Pokemon.  Then I trade them over to White 2 after beating the first gym (Kinda sucks but whatev), and then hatch and train them all the way through the game and cannot change them out ever.
I've done this once thus far and it was very fun to try out new Pokemon I've never used before.  Plus I named them all after food (which was easy with a team of edible Pokemon).
Rules:  Must be able to finish the game with them, ergo will likely need a Pokemon that can surf.
No Legendaries, since I can't breed them.
Starters should try not to be from Gen 5.

current projected Pokemon are

-Exeggutor
-Sableye
-Weezing

However, what if they combined a r/s remake with the fr/lg remake? I'm sure many of you have read the theory that they occurred around the same time and I think it would be really cool to be able to pick which story you want and then transfer your team to the next story after you complete one. 
I also think pal park is a pain in the ass to get kanto and hoenn pokemon into gen4 then use the other poketransfer to get into gen5!

I just had a question regarding the Dream World Eevees. I know there was some kind of event a couple years ago that allowed you access to eevees and their evolutions with Dream world natures. I missed that event and wanted to know if it is still possible to find eevees with DW natures. The reason I am asking this is because I want a Magic Bounce Espeon. And what is all the fuss about a female Dream world eevee as opposed to a male Dream World Eevee? 
Thanks guys and gals!!!!

Years ago I read a lengthy piece of fanfiction about the Pokemon world.  I barely remember anything about the content itself.  The things I do remember are:  1. It was written in diary form (entries).  2. There were a couple parts where people were saying things like ""We will call it ______"", the blank being the name of the Pokemon.  3. There was a part about a Raticate biting the hand off a soldier.
So, that's all I remember about this piece of fanfiction.  I do remember it was the BEST piece of writing I had seen in a long, long time.  If anyone knows what work I am talking about I'm sure we could all benefit from reading it.  Thanks so much!

I ended up on the route just before Victory Road (I forget the number, my apologies) when I saw the thunderstorm indicating that Thundurus was about.  I had seen him once before and knocked him down to about 25% health, but I wasn't too concerned with getting him now.  Usually with wandering legendaries I just toss an ultra ball at them and go on my merry way regardless of the result (they usually break out and flee).  Thundurus, however, was captured in a Dusk Ball, at the aforementioned 25% health, which did surprise me a bit.
I was reminded of my Soul Silver run, in which I actually managed to capture the Groudon at 50% health with a great ball.  I was so surprised by that luck that I actually named him Shenanigan (I still have Shenanigan, the cheeky bastard).
I know I'm not the only one with these unlikely success stories.  I guess I'm just really curious to hear about similar stories from r/pokemon.  Hit me with your best shot!

I'm a bit of a completionist when it comes to collecting games, and Pokemon was no exception. I had every Pokemon in existence at the time safely on my Silver cartridge. Not just a completed Dex; but a copy of every single final evolution Pokemon. What cartridges/systems would I need to pull this off with today's massive Dex? Is this even possible? I know there are event Pokemon that present challenges to obtain, as well. Which ones are there, and what is the likelihood of finding them? What has changed in training Pokemon since the days of yore?
I know this is a lot of questions, but I'm fairly sure they're easy for the hardcore Pokemon fans on here.

Do I have to wait until that point in the game aswell? I really hope now, I would like to trade some pokemon and get some others before then, some of the older gen pokemon.
Thanks for any help!

raticate and poliwhirl in gold
shiny smoochum with dizzy punch in crystal
zigzagoon was my first pokemon found in the wild on ruby
and i also got a shiny zubat from it as well
sapphire landed me a shiny bagon
...you win this round, emerald
shiny horsea in leafgreen
DPPt i had less luck however, I believe the only shiny I had in those games was meditite; cant remember which one
no gen 5 shinies yet
did they lower the chance or something? idk, it's just odd to see people spouting 'first in x number of years' to me. Your experience different from mine?

I've got pokemon ultra violet and shiny gold. With ultra violet, I'll play the story I know with the ability to capture all the pokemon myself and different starting pokemon, however I'm afraid I might get bored of the story, since I've played it half a dozen times already. With shiny gold, I've got a gba remake of gold (right?) so it's a new story to me but it's in the grey area of my interest in pokemon. 
So which direction do you guys think I should head? Also, if there are any rom hacks with just the first generation pokemon with a different story line or just significantly different from red/blue/fire/leaf that you'd recommend, that'd be great. 
Thanks!

So far my team in Pokemon Gold looks like this:
Quilava: Lv 33 (Flame Wheel, Quick Attack, Smokescreen, Leer)
Quagsire: Lv 33 (Surf, Ice Punch, Dig, Slam)
Ampharos: Lv 33 (Thunder Punch, Thunderwave, Headbutt, Cotton Spore
Girafarig: Lv 26 (Confusion, Shadow Ball, Stomp, Agility)..currently in training. She learns Crunch at 54 and Psybeam at 41 which will be replaced by Psychic.
A little bit of everything but I need two more Pokemon to round my team up. I know I need a flying but Pidgeot/Fearow are very underwhelming. So any advice would be appreciated!
Thanks!

Is the Pokemon world just one giant world with a huge amount of regions that each new game shows us individually each time? Why would Ash, someone who has ""Gotta catch 'em all"" stopping with just the region he was born in? And who the eff are the new characters that I am supposed to like each new game?

Let me lay down the way it is going to be done:
Pony posters are $40 or Pokemon for $30
I cover the shipping cost
If you are interested in getting a poster, send me a message.
Your message should include:
which Pokemon/pony you want
What you want the caption on the bottom to say (I don't need this right away)
Font (I don't need this right away)
any colors you would want (ex: background, font color, border color)
I look forward to making some posters for you guys. Thanks, IRL

Dark is good against both Psychic and Ghost, and so is Ghost, does this mean x8 damage???  I mean it would be hard to get these typings matched in an actual battle, but if they do ever occur, it spells instant death for the opponent (considering x4 usually is able to).  Is that even fair...? What's Reddits thoughts on this?

I've been trying to put together a team that would be effective, different and fun to play through the game with.
So far I've got:
-Turtwig
-Bagon
-Larvitar
-Duskull
-Zubat
-Pokemon Battle Revolution Pikachu
Unfortunately, not all of these members are really that great or fun to play through with. The Zubat, while different, is kind of boring to train and takes a lot of grinding to keep it up with the others, and it just can't put out enough damage to be effective in battle. The Pokemon Battle Revolution Pikachu is definitely interesting, as it has surf to use, but it's also a pain, since it has a different original trainer and grows too fast so it ignores orders half the time.
Does anyone have any suggestions for replacements? Maybe Croagunk for the Zubat; Poliwag or Spheal for the Pikachu?

2750	"Why I think Ruby and Sapphire remakes will be the next Pokemon games."	"0"	"19"	"20130520"	"Shifter25"	"So, the logic of when to do remakes is kind of up in the air right now.  We thought it was after 2 generations, but Gen V didn't have Gen III.  I also thought it might be when you couldn't trade back, like with FR/LG, but then why weren't there also Gold/Silver remakes until the DS.  Then recently, I thought of this:  The remakes will happen after two generations... of systems.
Think about it this way:  Gameboy had R/B.  Color had GSC (technically you could play GS on Gameboy, but they were programmed with actual colors, so...).  Gameboy Advance had RS and FR/LG, the first remakes, on the third system.  DS, DPP and HG/SS, the second on the fourth.  So, with 3DS, the fifth system, we will see the third remakes, a new Ruby and Sapphire.

In a mad dash our soon to be trainer is dressed and out the door in quickly saying goodbye to his single mother, running down the dirt road in his small town of Pallet. good thing the town is so small Oak¡¦s lab is in walking distance, so our friend makes it with seconds to spare.
As he enters he see many different machines and books. there is a healer and the professor's personal computer, while many other machines he doesn't know anything about are whiring like crazy. as he continues walking down the laboratory he see many of the Aids hard at work. he says hello to them while walks. 
Corey slowly opens the door to the meeting room where another trainer is with the Professor. 
¡§Hello there! Welcome to the world of Pokemon!¡¨, says the professor, ¡§My name is Oak! People call me the Pokemon Professor.¡¨ He shakes both of their hands. ¡§This world is inhabited by creatures called pokemon!¡¨
Oak pulls a pokeball out of his lab coat, summoning a pokemon. It¡¦s a short, chubby, rodent-like thing with yellow fur all over its body. Its ears are very long and the tips are colored black, With red circles on its cheeks and small little black pupils. 
¡§For some people, pokemon are pets. Others use them for fights. Myself?... I study pokemon as a profession¡¨.
¡§First, what are your names?¡¨, asks Oak.
¡§My name is Corey sir.¡¨, says Corey.
¡§ And my name is Justin!¡¨, he says in a ignorant voice. ¡§I already know so much about pokemon.¡¨
Corey looks at Justin with a annoyed expression. they have known each other since they were babies and have been rivals for as long as he can remember. 
¡§Hey maybe you should've spent more time study at the trainer school then daydreaming and sleeping in. I am surprised you weren't even late today.¡¨ says Justin with a devilish smirk on his face.
¡§Corey! Justin! You're very own Pokemon legend is about to unfold! Save the fighting for later, I know you will both push each other to be the very best you can.¡¨ , says Oak. ¡§ A world of dreams and adventures with your pokemon awaits!¡¨
¡§I was once a serious pokemon trainer. In my old age though i only have these three pokemon left.¡¨
Oak points to a table on the other side of the room. On it are three very old and mysterious looking  Pokeballs. 
¡§The fire type Pokemon, Charmander! The water type Pokemon, Squirtle! And the grass type Pokemon, Bulbasaur! I am willing to give both of you one too start your journey. Corey you can pick first. Choose carefully.¡¨
    ¡§I think I¡¦ll choose Bulbasaur!¡¨ exclaims Corey happily grabbing Bulbasaur¡¦s Pokeball. 
    ¡§Then I will choose Charmander!¡¨ shouts Justin. ¡§Good thing for me fire types are strong against grass types like your Bulbasaur.¡¨
    ¡§ I hope you too have fun and learn many things on your quest to become Pokemon masters.¡¨
    ¡§ See ya Corey, hope you don't get too far behind¡¨ said Justin as he leaves the lab.
. . .
    Corey is walking along with his trusty Bulbasaur on his side down the road. Its a dirt road that as been walked across many times by many different people, so as you can imagine its pretty flat, not so much loose dirt. There are a couple trees along the road. If you were too look closely enough you could see some Pidgey and Spearows in the branches. Down the road he can the first town in sight, Corey and Bulbasaur pick up speed excited too face the gym lead James.
    A young trainer stops them. He is wearing a backwards baseball cap, a yellow t-shirt and some blue shorts.
    ¡§Thats a nice looking Bulbasaur you got there.¡¨
    ¡§Thanks¡¨, says Corey, ¡§Care too tell me who you are?¡¨
    ¡§Oh sorry my name is Joey. Wanna see my Rattata?¡¨
    ¡§Sure why not.¡¨
    ¡§I choose you Rattata!¡¨
Joey throws his pokeball and Rattata comes out in a bright red light. Its a purple rat like creature. 
    ¡§Rattata is the only pokemon i raise. And will stay as the only pokemon i have. I just love it sooo much! My Rattata is definitely in the top percentage of Rattatas. Wanna see?¡¨  asked Joey with a determined smirk on his face. 
    ¡§Is that a challenge Joey?¡¨ , replies Corey. ¡§Because you are surely too lose.¡¨
    ¡§Whatever you say Corey. Are you ready?¡¨
    Corey nods his head slowly and takes a couple steps back.
    ¡§Go! Bulbasaur!¡¨
    ¡§Rattata! Go!¡¨
    ¡§Use you're tackle attack Bulbasaur!¡¨
    ¡§Rattata dodge it then use quick attack!¡¨
    Bulbasaur misses while Rattata quick runs around him and slams into Bulbasaur¡¦s side knocking him back.
    ¡§Vine whip now!¡¨
    ¡§Rattata use your agility attack and get in closer too Bulbasaur.¡¨
    Why can¡¦t I even touch this rat. ugh.. goes through Corey¡¦s mind.
    ¡§Finish him off with a hyper fang!¡¨
    Before Bulbasaur or Corey have a chance too react Rattata already has his fangs in Bulbasaur. Bulbasaur faints.
    ¡§Ha, I told you my Rattata was in the top percentage of Rattatas.¡¨
    ¡§Bulbasaur!¡¨, panics Corey as he scoops him up in a mad dash too the pokemon center in the town down the road.
He sprints down the road leaving a trail of dust behind him. Joey starts coffing from all the dust.
    ¡§Well that was rude, lets get going Rattata.¡¨, says Joey.
Corey kicks in the door too the Pokemon center rushing too the front counter.
    ¡§Nurse Joy you have too help my Bulbasaur!¡¨
    ¡¥Gasp!¡¦ ¡§Never let you're Pokemon get in this bad of shape again! I¡¦ll fix him up though, come back in a bit.¡¨
Corey walks out of the pokemon center thinking worried about Bulbasaur, feeling horrilbe. 
    ¡§Hey Corey!¡¨
Its Justin walking down the road waving at him. He looks stronger and more experinced already.
    ¡§Oh..Hey¡¨
    ¡§Ready for a battle?!¡¨, shouts Justin.
    ¡§I can¡¦t.¡¨ says Corey sadly.
    ¡§Huh?¡¨
    ¡§Bulbasaur¡¦s hurt. I can¡¦t battle you.¡¨
    ¡§Ha, I bet you don't even have any gym badges yet do you?¡¨
Corey shakes his head looking down at the gravelly ground.
    ¡§I already have two badges.¡¨, says Justin proudly. ¡§And my Charmander already evolved into a Chameleon. I can't believe you are already so far behind. Anyways I need to get going¡¦. Smell ya later!¡¨
    ¡§Guess I better go check on Bulbasaur then.¡¨
    ¡§ Ah you're Bulbasaur is as good as new.¡¨ says Nurse Joy with a heartwarming smile on her face as she hands Corey back Bulbasaur. Bulbasaur looks extremely happy and starts rubbing against Corey happy too see its trainer again. Corey laughs and gives it a hug.
    ¡§You ready too go beat the gym leader Bulbasaur?¡¨ asks Corey.
Bulbasaur nods its head more determined than ever to avenge itself after losing too Joey.
    ¡§Alright! Lets go!¡¨ says Corey laughing.
. . .
    ¡§James I challenge you too a Pokemon battle!¡¨ yells Corey as he walks into the pokemon gym.
    ¡§Ha. Alrighty. These will be a one on one battle for the Wave badge.¡¨ smirks James
    ¡§Bulbasaur go!¡¨
Bulbasaur runs out into the field. The field is kinda scattered brained with patches of land in a
big pool of water.
 ¡§Oh a Bulbasaur?¡¨,James says. ¡§Go Poliwag!¡¨
James throws his pokeball into the water and slowly a Poliwag floats up to the surface.
¡§ As this a water type gym and i specialize in water type pokemon, I only use water types, obviously.¡¨
¡§Razor leaf Bulbasaur!¡¨
¡§Quick dive in the water Poliwag!¡¨
Poliwag dives in the water but still gets hit with the razor leaf. It dived deep too where you can't see it.
¡§Ah! where did it go?¡¨ shouts Corey.
¡§Poliwag come up and use your water gun!¡¨
    It jumps out of the water on to the land and hits Bulbasaur with its water gun but it barely affects him. 
    ¡§Good job Bulbasaur! Now use your leech seed and follow it up with another razor leaf!¡¨
Bulbasaur launches its leech seed tying up Poliwag and fires it razor leaf right at it knocking it out.
 ¡§Yea! Haha! Great job Bulbasaur!¡¨ says Corey all excited.
¡§Ha well good job kid. You earned yourself the wave badge. Here you go.¡¨
James walks over and places the shiny new badge in Coreys hand.
¡§Woo-hoo! Lets go Bulbasaur!¡¨

I want to get into the newer (but not 3DS) games so I'm looking into buying a DS Lite/DSi. My question is which DS should I get? I've read that people say that the DS Lite is the best value for the money. However those reviews are all circa 2009. Its 2013 now so the price difference is basically a matter of $10.00 $79/$89 respectively for a used unit. That being said this is a question of what's the best gaming experience between the 2 handhelds. 
The guy at the game store recomends a Lite and that I start with HeartGold or SoulSilver. His reason was the Lite has a GBA slot so it would be best for Pokemon because you can import your Pokemon from Emerald into the DS titles. To me that sounds like decent advice but the DSi appears to be superior to the Lite hardware wise. Would I be missing that much by not playing and importing from Emerald? 
I'm leaning toward the DSi am I making the right decision?

2893	"My PokemonXY Best Wishlist (before the E3 roundtable)"	"24"	"9"	"20130610"	"HamTake"	"This is my wishlist of things I'd like to see in the upcoming PokemonXY. In before the roundtable discussion happening on the 11th. There is more to my wishlist for sure (some more or less nit picky than what I present here), but I'm no game designer and there's already a few good changes we've heard from the past months. Just to briefly describe where I'm coming from. I haven't played Pokemon since Ruby released, but since the announcement of XY I've been playing Soul Silver and White 2 like there's no tomorrow. Anyway here's my list and please feel free to share you own ideas as I would love to hear them!
(1) Storage to have Move Pokemon option first - The latest storage functions have made moving Pokemon around and organizing them relatively easy. It could only be better if the screen could be projected on a monitor or TV so that all the boxes could be viewed at once in full. So please Game Freak, make Move Pokemon the first option when turning on the PC!
(2) Be able to use Pokedex during battle - I think it would be really nice to be able to get limited Pokedex information while battling an NPC or wild Pokemon. Ash can do it, why can't we? [Obviously] the data would not be saved - the Pokemon still has to be caught for that, however I think this addition would make learning the new Pokemon easier. Every Pokemon deserves to grow their brand! Or something...
(3) Pokemon to evolve during battle - This would be epic. It happens in the show all the time and I would love to see someone's Pokemon evolve in the middle of a fight, especially since the game is modeled in 3D now. Make it happen once Game Freak! It can be totally scripted, I don't care! On more or less the same matter though, why should every fight be about fainting ALL of another trainer's friends? Stir things up and give us a bit of story or character!
(4) OOT camera control - Benches are great and so far they look like a mechanic for vistas, but how about the camera during regular movement? Since there isn't a second circle pad I hope that it would be possible to focus on the direction you're facing similar to how Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time does.
(5) Pokemon healing - I get this from my favourite RPG, Chrono Trigger. Pokemon with a healing skill should totally be able to perform their healing skill outside of battle (while spending a PP for it). You could argue then that Pokemon should be able to do a lot of things beyond having skills such as a lot of the HM moves, but that would be changing the game too much.
(6) Shorter animations for HMs - I think we heard that there would be less HMs in this game. Thank god! Though I also hope for more streamlined animations. Cut the foreplay please. I don't have to be reminded every time that Bibarel is my slave.
(7) More online goodness - The last two generations of Pokemon have been impressive on this note. Impressive from the Gameboy days anyway. We all want that official Pokemon MMO, but it's too much to ask for. Although with WiiU being more open than ever in terms of online interactions, I hope Game Freak takes at least two steps forward with online gimmicks in PokemonXY.
(8) StreetPass - I'm totally looking forward to battling trainers met by StreetPass. However, I'm still hoping there to be more than what Fire Emblem showed what is possible this year. Please surprise us Game Freak!

I'm not saying they don't deserve the love but why not share the love with those that don't see as much of it? Like Venipede or Kricketune. Who wouldn't admire a musical bug with a mustache. These are not the only Pokemon unrecognized though. How many people set out to get their very own Gloom? How many of us sit and marvel at Stantler? If you search this subreddit for any of the above Pokemon you'll find less than 30 results for each individual. If you search Eevee you get well over 800. Charizard has over 1200. And of course Pikachu surpasses 2500 with ease. Imagine r/pokemon like a high school though. Think back to how it worked. There were the jocks that got all of the attention, the goths that embraced the dark side of life, class clowns that were simply hilarious, ect. Then there were the outcasts. The group of people that the school never recognized. They seldom got any attention or applause for their contributions. It seems to me that Pokemon like Venipede, Kricketune, Gloom, and Stantler have been ignored just like the outcasts of a high school. So why not show them appreciation? Why not take a little time give them some love?

I would like to know which pokemon will be the most elusive (Febass, roaming legendaries) and which are simply impossible without cheating or trading (event exclusives). 
I plan on starting my quest when I go home in a few weeks so I can get my older games. I'm planning on playing in generational order (fireRed - > soulSilver - > Emerald - > Platinum - > White - > Black2). After beating them I'll try to find copies of the others to get any version exclusives. Also I plan on catching each generation of pokemon in their native generation. 
Any tips or comments on my journey to be the very best?

And I was getting all sad because I'm seeing other people getting gifts from their new santas and I'm just sitting here wondering why nothing is happening for me because Pokemon is my favorite thing and I'm hoping that if someone does send to me, it's not after my semester is over and then their gifting goes in vain.

Other than completing the national dex, or a living dex, or any kind of dex, and grinding battle towers to get items or records. But where is incentive to keep playing, with a new team? Aside from restarting the game, there is no adventure to be had for the poliwag I just hatched, and theres no incentive to go out and capture a pokemon I dont already have because ill never use it.
I think a major flaw in pokemon is that everything in the game can be done with one pokemon, and then have nothing else for any other pokemon. Sure, you can restart the game, but why did I bother catching that oddish if im not going to use. I know we all think this, which is why so many pokemon rot away in boxes
but what if there was an actual reason. A reason to re-travel across the lands, and getting the most out of every pokemon you catch. Maybe something like Mystery Dungeon where there are random missions always available. Or even close to Mass Effect 3's multiplayer, where you can reset and keep playing and playing with different builds with new content
Pokemon is one of the few games out there that live up to my definition of ""Exploring the sandbox"", Mass Effect 3 does this too, with the Arnax Arena, and multiplayer. Pokemon lets you do whatever you want with whatever you want, but once you're done, its all meta game. There are ways to let a game never end, and I think if pokemon did that, it would be even more unstoppable than it is now. 
Im not sure ive said what ive been trying to say. But for example, in my Leaf Green run, ive had the same 6 pokemon for generally ever, and once I beat the elite 4 I moved 4 of them to Heart Gold, now im on the sevii islands doing its stuff with 2 of them, and 4 new pokemon. This is close to what I want. 
When I was in the safari zone catching pokemon to fill the dex, I realised that was the only reason I was catching them. Catching a pokemon should feel like im gaining a valuable tool for the future, similar to signing a free agent in a hockey game, but alas, that nidorina will be deleted when I restart the game, because I have no reason to use her. 
If there was some system put in place, that allowed me to go all around the region, doing what ever, that isnt grinding or training for the meta game, allowing me to use new pokemon in situations similar to ambushes by enemy teams, or rivals, or fetch quests, or whatever else there is in RPGs that last forever, then I want it, and I will pay money for it

I remember hearing Skyrim had infinite sidequests and went on forever, and had faults. If pokemon had something like that, and fixed the faults, then shut up and you know the line.

I thought it was pretty funny that they added in the kind of humor that she brings to the table and I was too young when i played red, blue and yellow to even notice this kind of humor.

Take for example the the Pokemon battling channels on Youtube. What percentage of them have legitimately trained the stats to their Pokemon?

So he sends out a Flygon, and it manages to go before Starmie, killing it with Dragon Claw. Here's what I don't understand. Flygon's base speed is 100, while Starmie's base speed is 115. My Starmie is trained to have maximum speed (31 IVs, 252 EVs), meaning that even if that Flygon were maxed out in speed too, Starmie still should have gone first because of its higher base speed.
So I figure it's probably holding a Choice Scarf (which raises speed by 1.5x, but locks you into one move), but toward the end of the video you can see that Flygon uses Fire Blast, and its ability to use two different moves indicates it is not holding a Choice Scarf. So how was it able to outspeed Starmie?
Edits: Also, I couldn't record the whole battle because it was too long, but the team did not use Tail Wind or anything prior to this moment. And you can see Quagsire using Bulldoze, which does lower speed, but I rewatched the full video and it did not hit Starmie with this. 
TL;DR: Base 100 speed Flygon outspeeds base 115 max-speed Starmie without a Choice Scarf; how is this possible?

I'm in need for some help and tips, because I've never breeded pokemon before, atleast not with the intent of passing on moves to other pokemon.
My scenario is as follows; I have a Tropius(female) with Solarbeam, and I also have a Vileplume that I can learn Solarbeam via a TM. I want to get another oddish so I can get a Bellossom with Solarbeam to.
To my understanding, when you breed outside of pokemon ""race"", the egg becomes the female pokemon?
So the easiest route would be to breed Tropius(female) with a compatable pokemon, and then hope that it becomes a Tropius(male) so I can breed that one with a Oddish(female)?
[Compatable pokemon](male) + Tropius (female) ---> Tropius (male) + Oddish (female) ---> Oddish?
If I got it wrong, please feel free to correct me, I have no to little understanding about this topic!

"1"	"1"	"20130708"	"ashwastheworst"	"So after seeing the gen 1/2 sprite-style of the gen 5 pokemon on the frontpage, I started thinking about how much the art style actually changed over the generations and how it for me changed quite a bit how I felt towards the pokemon game series. 
I was wondering how anybody else felt towards the new visual styles of each generation and how it changed their perspective on Pokemon. 
Link to the post im talking about: 
http://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/1hu88j/and_suddenly_nextgen_pokemon_are_original/
As someone growing up with the gen 1 games and loving gen 2 even more, I never could really get into the new games (I really disliked gen 4) due to the visual style. For me personally, the more clear and colorfull(more saturated) sprites of both the old and the new pokemon made a lot of them feel boring and generic to me. The older sprite style just left more to the imagination. This really helped the fact that every pokemon of the same kind, all Pikachu, looking exactly the same. The vague and odd sprites designs with unsaturated/low-contrast colors made this less of a problem for me. 
I really disliked the 4th gen pokemon designs, mainly because of the sprites used for them. I thought the new evolution to old pokemon were the worst ever, but I actually really did like a lot of them once I saw them in the anime style. 
The new visual style of X and Y makes me really excited, simply because it seems to be much more similar to the Anime visuals. .

Releasing all the Pokemon under the guise of wanting what's good for them but really because Ghetsis wants to be the only one who controls them? That was awesome. It acknowledged the debate about whether or not it's ethical for children to keep monsters in tiny balls and force them to fight each other. Flare just kind of falls flat after that. Anyway, I'm hoping that they have some ulterior motives or something revealed later in the game or maybe I'm missing their point entierly. If the latter is the case, please let me know.

*10 Thunder. You all probably know what thunder does but it is a special electric move that has a base damage of 120 and an accuracy of 70. It also has a 30% chance of paralyzing the opponent. If that isn't enough, in rain it has 100% accuracy,  and in diamond/pearl/platinum has a 30% chance of breaking through detect or protect, but, in sunshine it has 50% accuracy.
*9 Surf. It does 95 base damage but doubles power if the opponent is using dive.
Surf has 100 accuracy and has the highest base damage of all hm's so you can surf while you are surfing, listening to the surf.
*8 Slack Off. All this move does is restore half of your max hp. This move is really useful considering how much health this recovers.
*7 Draco Meteor. This move has a high base damage of 140 but sharply lowers your special attack, and only has a accuracy of 90. Not much else to say.
*6 Blizzard.  With a 10% chance to freeze the opponant, this move has a base power of 120 and an accuracy of 70 which could be changed to 100 in a hailstorm. In diamond/pearl/platinum it has a 25% chance of breaking protect and detect.
*5 Blue Flare It has a base power of 130 and an accuracy of 85, and a 20% chance of leaving a burn.
*4 Explosion You may think that this is number 20 but it has a base damage of 250 and in gen 1-4 the opponent's defense stat is halved. In gen 1 it has a base power of only 170. This is good if you are fighting an over powered enemy with 20 hp left. You'll die anyway. Take them with you.
*3 Magma Storm. It has a base power of 120 and for 4-5 turns afterwards it deals 1/16 damage. If the opponent has 400 hp then each turn it takes around 25 damage so if you are lucky you could do almost 280 damage in 5 turns. (Counting base power)
*2 Outrage. It attacks for 2-3 turns doing a base power of 120 each turn. However at the end of the move it causes confusion. But if your pokemon has own tempo or is holding a persim berry it dosent cause confusion. This saved me so many times in emerald.
*1 V-Create It has a base damage of 180 and an accuracy of 95. While it lowers both defense stats and speed. That won't matter if they cant hit you. A level 100 victiny is the best.

Also maybe if a pokemon has more than twice (or maybe 3x) then it can select 2 attacks for 1 turn. Any thoughts?

-First of all I managed to Cause a Status effect on a pokemon and the letters pop up next to the hp and just says the word on whole. Before hand it would be shortened. So it is the small things that count guys!
-When in the mega Mewtwo battle you are literately forced to mega evolve. This could mean that they are hiding something due to the fact it has been stated before that you are able to chose when to mega evolve.(The mega Evolve button was there btw)
-It looks like you use your skates by using the circle pad and when when you use the D pad your character jumps to the closest grid square and walks around while using the D pad. If you start to use the Circle Pad you will start to use your roller skates.
-I also noticed at the very end of the demo you go into a place. Now now looking on the map you see the route you are on and it leads strait to Lumiose City. 
-Last thing is that I did not see any new pokemon while playing. Also I got to play the Demo 3 times.

"2"	"6"	"20130930"	"MuzzFury[Vulpix]"	"The slogan back when Blue/Red came out was ""There are 150 Pokemon"" so the Pokedex always ended with Mewtwo as the #150th Pokemon and later on you got Mew as the #151st Pokemon. So my question was then why did it end with MewTWO as the 150th Pokemon instead of with the original Mew? My thoughts behind this is in this ""Pokemon World"" Mew exited long before Mewtwo ever came around so you would think the Pokedex entry would include Mew as #150 and then later on as Mewtwo was created and discovered by humans he would be put at entry #151. 
So what do you guys think? Am I right and you guys wondered this too, am I making no sense, did the developers have a certain reason for doing this, do the Pokedex entries have no relation to the order Pokemon were discovered, or am I looking too much into a cartoon shows logic?

I do not wish to give my opinion on whether I feel this type of content should be ""self post only"" or not, I just want to offer this advice. 
We cannot simply go by the honor system here and just request for people to make image macros, screengrabs and the like self-posts when it is currently just as easy to make them link posts and have the extra incentive of shiny internet points. We would need rules against these specific link posts and actual action taken against those who violate these rules. Not every redditor is capable of groundbreaking posts, but many still want to contribute. If we flat-out disallow low-effort posts, I feel there will be a little less cynical discussion about the subreddit and maybe some more discussion about Pokemon. 
Tl,dr: If we as a community don't want ""karma whoring"" to occur from image macros, we need concrete rules against it.

Using the example, I should have 50% chance of passing on a 31 atk IV when the game pulls from the parents as opposed to that being the one stat that is auto-generated. Yet, I will get a batch of 5 eggs in a row that do not have a perfect IV in attack.

I only used Feraligatr but I caught a bunch of other Pokemon to teach HM moves to. So I had a level 100 Feraligatr and the rest of my party were the same level as when I caught it, just with HM moves. Fast-forward to Red in Mt. Silver, I face him with my Feraligatr and I KO most of his team. He only has a lvl. 70 Venasaur left. It used Solarbeam on me which destroyed my Feraligatr. I was lucky it didn't know Sunny Day or else this might not have happened. So the only good Pokemon I had essentially was dead so naturally, I thought it was over. However, I had a Hoothoot that was lvl 3ish who knew Fly. So I sent it out and hoped for the best. What happened was whenever Venasaur charged a Solarbeam, it had to wait a turn. During that turn, my Hoothoot would then use Fly and be invulnerable for one turn. Because of this, Venasaur's Solarbeam missed everytime and my Hoothoot did 1 point or so of damage to Venasaur. Red was stupid enough to continue using Solarbeam for the remainder of the fight because he headbutted one too many trees in his day. This went on for about an hour until I finally took down Venasaur! I remember my Hoothoot evolved after that fight into Noctowl. It evolves into Noctowl at about lvl 20, so my Hoothoot gained at least 17 levels! (3-20+) and stopped at lvl 26.  After that was over, I quit Pokemon Silver because I knew I couldn't top that shit.  And I got Crystal :)

3484	"The Value of a Pokemon, in US Dollars"	"1"	"12"	"20131021"	"jacobetes"	"Hello everyone! I come bearing a challenge!
After a discussion with u/simplymilk on the value of Ylvetal on the GTS, I began wondering, what is the value of any given pokemon? What is it that makes a pokemon valuable?
My first thoughts were its rarity, its scarcity, its viability in Competitive Terms, and its Base Stat Total. I would also like to include its popularity, however that is vastly impossible to quantify. 
NOTE: I have left shininess out of the equation, because the general consensus seems to be that a shiny pokemon tends to be double or even triple the value of that pokemon, which is an easy bit of math after the fact, and is heavily reliant on personal preference. 
The formula i first came up with is:
P = (E/Ng X T) X 100
Where:
P = Price in USD
E = Average Encounter Rate
Ng = Number of Games that pokemon appears in
T = Tier multiplier (see below)
Tier Multipliers as a number associated with each Smogon competitive tier. The values are as follows:
Ubers = 3
OU = 2
BL = 1.75
UU = 1.50
BL2 = 1.33
RU = 1.25
NU = 1
To check this formula for ""accuracy"" i used the following pokemon as examples.

Pikachu = (.21/11) X 1 X 100 = $1.90
Ferrothorn = (.33/2) X 2 X 100 = $16.66
Gengar = (.59/90 X 2 X 100 = $13.11
Lugia = (100/2) x 3 x 100 = $15000
Charizard = (83.25/3) X 1 X 100 = $2775

As you can see, this cannot be accurate, as it does not apply very well to pokemon with high encounter rates. My initial formula doesnt work, because pokemon with higher enoucnter rates tend to be worth more, while they should be worth less, because everyone has one. 
As I am no mathematician, I was wondering if anyone knew what i did wrong, or had any suggestions to accurately decide the price of a pokemon.

It works like this, there is a wild zubat, and there is a move that is phychic/flying.  The effectiveness of psychic types is x2, and flying types is x1, so the total damage is x1.5
(2+1)/2=1.5
Now heres another example, A wild Magcargo appears.  You, being smart, send out Swampert.  Swampert uses muddy water, a water/ground attack and it has x4 effectiveness for both types it has:
(4+4)/2=4?
But, Swampert being a water/ground pokemon gets double STAB from it.
How would r/pokemon feel about this?
TL;DR Dual type moves are calculated by the average effectiveness of each of their types.  It is possible to get double STAB from them.  How do you feel about this?

The first three legendary Pokemon (Articudo, Moltres, and Zapdos) typing was Ice, Fire, and Electric (all with part flying). 
Then with the Unova three legendary Pokemon (Kyurem, Reshiram, and Zekrom) whose typing was Ice, Fire, and Electric (with dragon as a secondary type) These legendary trios both have Ice, Fire, and Electric as a type
After this you have the Johto duo: Lugia and Ho-Oh (Physic/Flying and Fire/Flying respectively)  So my theory for Xerneas & Yveltal is that they are (Xerneas: Physic/Dragon) and (Yveltal: Fire/Dragon)
So my planning is that you have A trio with Ice, Fire, and Electric and then skip two generations and have a Duo with Fire and Physic.
This is just my theory,  any other reddior's input would also be good.

This urban legend is about the first production copies having you meet Mew before you get your first pokemon instead of meeting Prof. Oak first and having him give you your first pokemon.  This Mew was originally going to wish you good luck on your journey but because of certain programmers (i don't remember how to spell their names properly so i will include two stories explaining all of this in great detail) it caused the people that played these first print copies to go insane and kill themselves. 
Both stories i have included have explained both have explained this in better detail than I have gone over.
Something else that i find really creepy about this lavender song is when you analyze it and look at the sound waves a ghost and some unknown appear even though unknown was not introduced until gen 2.  Below is a video of that.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&v=MXDtXlEZxvY#t=104s
This first story explains about both in a lot more detail than the second story but leaves out the part about mew.

This second story does not have as much detail but explains more about the Mew thing I explained above.
http://viridiancitykanto.blogspot.ca/2012/02/secret-of-mew-and-cursed-cartridges.html
I honestly believe this is true but not sure how someone could be able to do this or why they would have done this.

And it got me thinking 'Hey, what if I did this with other pokemon?' 
I essentially spent the past 6 hours practicing drawing and then putting together a Lopunny and Gastly (Gastly was the prototype for a friend, Lopunny I am super proud of.) I will post up the prototype tomorrow (The hand drawn and coloured pencil version) and then hopefully after that I will be able to put in an electronic version with my friends drawing tablet thing. (Quite horrible with those though so it will take probably an extremely long time to do) But I want to get feed back from you guys about the prototype and if you like them.
If a lot of people like them, I don't mind making other pokemon doing the same thing. So like Charizard, Mewtwo, Eevee and ect. I can make it vertical for Iphones, Androids ect or I can make it horizontal for blackberries. 
Hopefully you will like my Lopunny and Gastly tomorrow, I would enjoy lost of feedback! (They aren't up tonight cause I don't wanna wake anyone up with the scanner in my house.)

I grew up with Pokemon. I too discovered the anime first, and admittedly only in recent years learned the show was based on the game, not the other way around. 
I started with Blue, which came to America when I was 7, and later played Yellow and Crystal (both of which were stolen by a neighbor). But it wasn't until Ruby and Sapphire that Pokemon truly found it's way into my heart.  
In April and May of 2004, I was spending a LOT of time in the waiting room of a Houston hospital, where my mother was hospitalized. As a way to pass my time, my grandmother took me to get a new game. I chose Pokemon Ruby. Since I was spending 8 or more hours a day at the hospital, I spent a lot of time playing.  
One day, after my mother was released from ICU, but was still in the hospital, my mom noticed me playing the slots in the Mauville Game Corner. Ironically, her handheld slots has just died moments before. SO naturally, she asked me if she could play. Of course, in her bedridden state, it was impossible to say no.  
As it would happen it became a routine of me leaving my GBA with her while I was at school, and she'd load me up on coins. But then the call came. I was at school, when the phone in our classroom rang. I was called to the office, where the secretary was waiting for me. She had a grim look on her face, and said ""It's your mother"" before handing me the phone. Of course this terrified me, because the school was well aware of my mother's condition.  
Needless to say, the secretary was shocked when I burst out laughing. My mom was calling to ask me how to get more coins. For the first time in a month, she was out. I told her to go to the desk and buy more coins, at which point she confessed to having already spent all of my money, meaning she needed more. And so came my mom's first battle. I sat there in the office, explaining over the phone to a 31 year old woman, how to have a Pokemon battle, so she could get more coins for slots.  
Fast forward a few months to Christmas morning. The first gift I opened was a new GBA SP. Curious, because I already had one, I asked why I was getting a second one, at which point my mom told me she had bought herself Sapphire, and rather than buying herself a new GBA, she was buying me a new one, and borrowing my old one. Turns out, I had created an addiction in her. She enjoyed battling more than the slots that had gotten her started.  
Mid spring 2005, after me and my mom had both completed Ruby and Sapphire, we got FireRed (me) and LeafGreen (her). Of the dozen or so people I knew who played Pokemon, my mom was the only one who could defeat me in a battle. The student had become the master.  
Heartbreak came in September of 2005, when my mother passed away. She didn't have very many possessions left to her name, but that didn't matter. 
I continued playing my Third Gen Pokemon games for a few years, but due to being broke, never transitioned to the DS games. In late 2009 I met my father through Facebook (I was living with my grandmother at the time) and shortly afterwards came to California on a two week visit. Entirely by accident I left my GBAs (I had three of them by now) back in Texas. This would prove to be a disappointment, when at the end of my two week visit, I stayed in California.
Mid 2011, I got my first DS for 40 bucks off of Craigslist. I went to game stop and traded in the two games that had come with it (Mario Party and Nintendogs) for 12 dollars, and added some cash to get a used copy of Pokemon Platinum. Shortly after, a co-worker gave me Diamond, HeartGold, and Black, because he had ""Gotten Bored"" with the games.  
Anyways, it was around this time that my grandmother in Texas passed away, and my aunt paid for my to fly out for a week to help sort my grandmother's things. Obviously, I brought my GBAs and Games with me.
With my GBAs, I was finally able to introduce my little brother (he's almost 7 now) to Pokemon. My mom had never defeated the Elite four in her LeafGreen before passing, and I had never erased her file. SO over the course of a couple hours, I fought the E4, looked through her boxes, and then with several tears, erased her save file, as well as my FireRed file. It was time for my brother's adventure to begin.
He whined and cried at first, when he wasn't able to win battles, but a year and a half later (now) he's not a bad trainer, if I may say so myself. He watches the Anime, and tells his classmates at school that I'll kick their poke-butts if they challenge me. 
I've been a Poke-master as far back as I can remember, and I plan to remain one as long into the future as possible. I've battled my mother and lost more than I could count, and just last week, my brother won his first battle against me (admittedly I was going easy). With the the coming generations, I plan to share my adventure with him, just as I shared my younger adventures with my mother, and look forward to the day that my second student becomes a master in his own right.

You must have Ash's complete team from that region by the time you take on the elite four.
The time at which you evolve your pokemon does not have to correspond with the anime. (My exception for this is hoenn in my case as grovyle doesn't evolve until battle frontier)
Only other starter pokemon can be traded in to the game and must be traded in at the stage ash receives them. All other pokemon must be caught yourself.
Grinding is definitely allowed.

How you handle pokemon that are released mid-game is a problem and I am unsure on how to handle and when.
Feedback is greatly appreciated

4. Generation 4, good games, a lot to do with interesting graphics, just I seemed kinda bored at times playing it, still loved it though.
5. Generation 5, the games were decent. To me, everything just seemed strained and the games just didn't hit me like all the others..

It's been a great time (although I'm VERY partial to Gen I pokemon) but I'm thinking about getting into it moreso than I used to.
I've read some competitive stuff but I have a few questions for you guys that I haven't found the answers to, so here goes:
1.) What do I absolutely HAVE to know? I know about IV's EV's, types, and abilities. Beyond that I don't know a whole lot. I've read up on some pokemon on smogon but I'm still fairly inexperienced.
2.) Can I play with my favorite pokemon (Golduck and Alakazam currently) and experience a fair degree of success? I know these competitive tiers are often the top of the top making teams and placing these pokemon in tiers...I don't think I want to get into the game THAT much.
3.) Any other tips for a new competitive player? I have been trying to look around but I haven't found anything comprehensive regarding teaching someone about competitive play. 
Thanks a lot to anyone that responds. I really appreciate it!
TL;DR I need tips for getting into competitive play but I don't plan on being VERY competitive, mostly just wifi battles with random people.

I would not consider myself a casual player but I am definitely not a hardcore player either. I don't know if there is a good word for an in betweener like me. I don't care much for EV training but I usually try to get a good nature for my pokemon.  
Anyways, onto my questions:  
1. When I am leveling up lower level pokemon (likely with exp. share), is it bad to fight something which is going to yield high amounts of experience that would result in multiple level-ups for the lower level pokemon?  
I just mean in terms of EVs. I'm really not that big into EV training but if I am cutting myself short on them by powerleveling pokemon compared to the old fashion way then it is going to bother me. An example would be, I defeat a level 100 Magikarp while I have Exp. Share on my level 5 Rattata resulting in a 20+ level increase for my Rattata.  
1a. If the answer to question 1 is ""yes, that is bad."" then what is the best way to level pokemon quickly on black/black2 era?  
2. I don't really understand some of the finer points when it comes to breeding. If I have two Dragonites get it on, do I get a Dragonite in the egg or will it be a Dratini?  
2a. How is the nature of the baby egg pokemon determined? Is it completely random or does the parent pokemon play a part into it?  
I really would just like to get a nature I like on an Aerodactyl on Black2. But I usually have to catch 40+ of the same pokemon just trying to get a nature I want regularly. I really don't have the patience to breed 40+ Aerodactyl.  
2b. Is it better to use the male and female of the same pokemon for breeding over a pokemon and Ditto? Or does it not even matter?  
3. And lastly is there a place where I can, like, uhh, find friends? lol...  
Not even for the pokemon games in particular but I have noticed a lot of the games I own have a decent aspect of the game oriented around other friends that play that game too. And if you are in the forever alone group like me, I feel like I am kinda missing out.  
I know I had a couple more but it is late here and I am super tired. I would appreciate your feedback. Thanks!

However, I feel like getting back into it, and I want to get my wife playing as well, as I think she'll enjoy them, despite never having played before.
From the looks of it, Black and White and their sequels are the best games available currently. I think it makes sense to buy us both 3DSs, rather than regular DSs, so my questions are thus:

Do the original Black and White make use of some of the features of the 3DS? I've read some stuff about B/W2 using 3DS features and having semi 3D graphics - is this the case for the originals as well?
If we haven't played Black and White, will that decrease our enjoyment if we go straight to B/W2? Or should we make sure to play Black and White first?

Anyway, I've been in and out of Pokemon since then, with barely being a part with Crystal and then dropping out completely between R/S/E. I came back for a bit with B/W and now I'm headstrong into X and Y. 
So, while casually playing B/W I learned about competitive battling and was far too intimidated by it. I have recently grasped the concept of EV training and IV breeding. However, I do not know where to find a good site to determine good builds and teams. 
I'm also in an attempt to complete the national dex, so a site to help track that would be awesome as well. I know there is a lot of resources and information online, but I don't know where to begin. 
I would also like to know of a good EV training site or iOS app. 
tl;dr long time fan. want to start competitive training. understand IV and EV. need website with builds and team development.

What if, like shiny pokemon, you could find wild pokemon that were vastly stronger than the rest of their species in one stat field. But unlike shiny pokemon , you wouldn't be able to tell unless you caught it or noticed it in battle.
For example, I stumble across a pikachu that has an OP Special attack rating of 400. 
with the same odds as being shiny, but without any indicator, it would be rare enough that not everybody you meet has one; and the fact that it's only one stat field would make sure that its not a complete wrecking ball either. 
just a thought. I'd love to hear you guys' opinion on it!

So, on serebii, they announced, or rather displayed a sketch of a new pokemon that resembles a tree, Orotto
Now, here's what I've noticed, he is a tree, with 4 roots for legs. now I immediately made the connection to Yggdrasil, the giant tree in norse mythology, the one with the giant BIRD at the top, has a bunch of STAGS with long branch like Antlers, and a dragon at the bottom. I think there's a good chance that this pokemon will be tied into the mythology.

Any input, maybe help using this core in a full team?
For reference...
Scizor @ life orb
*Swords Dance
*Bullet punch
*Bug Bite
*Ariel Ace?
Greninja @ focus sash
*(Protean)

*Scald/Surf (not sure if hitting scizor is worth it)

However, without doing any further research I also maxed out Speed because I wanted to be able to take out opponents quickly. I then read up on it and realized that Clawitzer is really slow and I'm not sure if fully EV training it in Speed fixes that.
So my question is this; Should I get a Reset Bag and waste another hour of my life maxing out another stat for him, or does the maxed out Speed stat make much of a difference on such a naturally slow Pokemon?
Sorry if this is not the right place to ask this. Have a nice day!

Personally, I'm hoping for Empoleon's mega will fix his averageness. With boosts to either his offenses or defenses, he'll be much better. Give him some defense buffs to be a better tank (ten resistances and an immunity is nothing to laugh at), or boost his speed and attack stats to make him a better sweeper (Hydro pump/Flash Cannon/Ice Beam gives pretty good coverage).

It would keep it's moves and it wouldn't devolve, but stats and EVs would reset - don't worry about wasting all those hours you spent EV training the perfect Pokemon, because there's more - when your Pokemon resets, it's IVs change depending on the EVs it had before it reset. So if you had a LV.100 Infernape with max EVs in attack, when it resets to LV.1, it would have max IVs in attack, and a little star would appear next to the attack stat in the menu to show this. If you then levelled up that Infernape to LV.100 again, but this time with max EVs in defence, if you reset it again It would have max IVs in both attack and defence. You could keep doing this until it had max IVs in every stat - I know it seems tedious to get to LV.100 six times, but it's a lot more fun than going through thousands of eggs :)
What do you think? Do you like my idea, or is there something I've missed out? Please tell me!

Contrary's effects are said on bulbapedia : ""This Ability causes all effects that would lower a stat to increase it instead, and all effects that would increase a stat to decrease it instead.""

1. he's a fairy slayer with STAB bonus for poison jab, which is absolutely crucial in this game
2. hypnosis/dream eater is always an incredible combo, and certainly for catching pokemon, hypnosis is invaluable. plus, with the advent of those stupid little luvdisc's, heart scales are easy to get, so going to the move relearner to get hypnosis doesnt cost you
3. he's one of the early attainable mega evolutions, and although he loses his immunity to ground type, when that little guy grows legs, he will straight up murder you and consume your dreams
4. he's fast as hell
5. his available moves are incredibly diverse, you can make him be anything you need
6. he's a ghost, so you can nickname him something badass like ""Swayze""
in short, trainers, gengar I nominate him for most valuable pokemon. i'd be interested to hear others' MVPs, but he's mine.

4212	"Kindness"	"18"	"9"	"20130616"	"tnt140"	"Here's the story,
I work at a movie theatre and last night I was working in the box office selling tickets. I see so many people come in and many of whom are extremely rude or just love to complain about anything. I also see many lost objects turned in: mainly from fellow staff who find these things while cleaning the auditoriums after each showing. Last night, however, took a rather refreshing turn. 
It was inbetween shows, which means all the movies have started an it is quite dead in the lobby (very few people). During this time a young couple, maybe in their mid-twenties came in. It was at this moment that took me a little by surprise because the guy was holding a blue 3DS XL. At first I thought that was awesome, but then they begin telling me that they found it in the parking lot next to a car. This couple was concerned enough to bring it in to us at the theatre so it did not get run over or stolen. This is a big deal for anyone who owns or is looking to own a 3DS XL because they aren't cheap! So I took the 3DS XL from them and they also have me the type of car and it's license which the 3DS XL was next to. After selling them tickets for Man of Steel (I think), I immediately began to log this in our Lost and Found book. While doing this I noticed there was a game in the DS slot. I checked which game it was for identification purposes (in case the owner came in and asked for) so it wouldn't get stolen. To my surprise is was Pokemon Platinum. I was overjoyed and also sad because whoever this belongs to must really be upset/disappointed. 
However, it is securely safe in our office and I hope the owner has the idea to check the movie theatre. If it wasn't for that young couple, it may have well been destroyed or taken. 
TL;DR: Kind couple turned in a lost 3DS XL with Pokemon Platinum.

So I am breeding Magikarps (one holding a destiny knot) trying to get the IV transfer correct so I can just breed the same egg over again for a female Eevee. 
My questions are:
Is the destiny knot meant to transfer 5 IVs from the parents or it it up to 5, as guides on this method are stating you will get 5 transferred and then the stat you don't care about (attack in my case) the stat that isn't inherited from the Mother and Father will be a chance of 1/6. 
Does Destiny Knot matter on which gender of pokemon it is on?
And is gender decided when an egg is in holding by the Day-Care man or when you receive it?

"0"	"11"	"20131125"	"bamhm182"	"So I was thinking today, and outside of things like battling and trading, there's not really much of a reason to keep people in your friend safari if you have all 3 of their pokemon with all 3 of their hidden abilities is there? I'm just thinking this because I'd like to free up some space on my friends list for Shiny Value trades. It seems to me that if you have a Water type friend with Krabby, Wartortle, and Poliwhirl, once you catch one with Sheer Force, Rain Dish, and Swift Swim, you can safely delete that friend.
My thinking is that if you want the hidden ability, you have it. If you want the normal ability, you'll get it after a few breeds. If you want increased shiny odds, you can use the TSV/ESV method. The only exception I can think of to this would be ditto, because you can always use more dittos until you get a shiny 31x6 ditto since they don't breed.
Anyone else have any other thoughts on this?

You have the standard dance pad with DDR, and every song lets you start as a certain Pokemon (at the bottom of a 3-stage evo line). As you dance well, you gain exp and the better you do, the more you level up and evolve. Fully evolving is an expert score.
The music can be tracks from Pokemon games, as well as themes from the anime (both English and Japanese).
In bonus dances, you start as Legendary Pokemon.

Team Cypher shows up with their shadow Pokemon again after you defeat the Champion and Elite Four, you can get the snag machine and catch and purify these shadow Pokemon, which happen to be imported from the Kanto, Johto, Hoenn, Sinnoh, and Unova regions!

For the purpose of gaming/grinding you can just run through continuously.

You'd fly there to accept the challenge etc. But also if you wanted to grind you could still challenge the elite 4. could give the sense of actual competitiveness within the single player world.

We'll finally be able to check EV's without having to use stat calculators or some other annoying method.  But there's one feature I feel that needs to be improved.  Migration.
The closest I think Game Freak have gotten to perfect with the migration thing is Pal Park.  You stuck your cartridge in and selected six Pokemon to transfer.  The downsides were that you could only do this once a day (presumably to prevent abuse of the feature and that Pokemon could not be transferred if they knew HM moves.  You then could re-catch the Pokemon pretty easily after transfer.
Black and White took huge step backwards.  The mini game is annoying and quite frankly just waists time.  I haven't migrated from generation three to four  in years so I don't remember how long Pal Park.  I do remember that it could take some time to find all of your Pokemon though.  But why do features like transferring Pokemon need to have a mini game patched on to it?  What's wrong with just transferring them to the PC box?  I assume it's because Game Freak was trying to make a feature fun.  But for someone like me who has hundreds of Pokemon to transfer it's a very tedious task.
One the bright side, we did get the ability to do it as often as we wanted.  So there was no more changing the DS clock back and forth.  So that did save some time in a way.  But we still can't transfer with HM moves.  I assume this is because they don't want players to get themselves stuck somewhere in an older game.  But it's still rather annoying to go and delete several moves from various Pokemon.
On top of this, migrating now requires two DS systems to transfer.  Back in the days of the Gold and Silver, it was understandable that you needed two game boys to use the time capsule.   But the DSi/3DS have the ability to download extra software.  And we know from the Dream Radar that BW/BW2 can interface with eShop software.  So why couldn't we transfer Pokemon some way like that?
So for X/Y, I propose that the process is simplified greatly.  It's still only available after beating the game to prevent the transfer of overpowered Pokemon to get through the game but everything else is greatly simplified.
You download an eShop app.  It's free and comes with everything you need.  Upon opening it for the first time, you're greeted with a prompt that welcomes you to the software and explains its purpose.  You're then asked if you would like to allow the transfer of Pokemon that know HM moves.  There's also a warning that states that transferring Pokemon that know HM's may get you stuck somewhere in your game and it advises you to think carefully  about your settings.  You can change this at anytime later in the options menu if you desire.
After this, you can begin the process of transfer.  You insert your Gen. V cartridge into the 3DS and the software brings up your PC boxes, you can then select the Pokemon you wish to transfer.  The limit of the number of Pokemon you cant transfer is now bigger to save you from having to go back and forth between the two games.
So you select the Pokemon you want to transfer and allow it to work its magic.  Your Pokemon are now stored inside of the 3DS system.  From here, you can retrieve your Pokemon through X/Y.
The best way to do this it most likely via the options menu at the start of the game.  You hit the migrate option and your Pokemon are then transferred to your PC boxes.  Any items they held are transferred to your bag.
Let me know what you guys think of this.  Would you prefer a simplified transfer system like I suggested?  Or do you not mind Game Freak turning it into a game?
I know they've said they're ""working on something"" and that migration may not even be possible for Generation VI.  But if it is, this is the way I would prefer it.  Short, simple, and takes a lot less time than playing a mini game.

I think VI, considering how much of a paradigm shift it appears to be, should definitely be a reset point.  That means no transferring from Generation V to VI, but allow all previous Pokemon to be caught in other games when they come out.

Playing with a Pokemon increases its friendship with the player, and allows it to avoid attacks and land critical hits more often.

I like this change for single-player; it makes sense. A happy pokemon is a healthy pokemon. But how would this affect the competetive scene? The evasion clause! forbids moves like double team and minimize, because they are deemed broken and uncompetetive.
I do not like the thought of every pokemon in ranked battles walking around with an inate 7.5% evasion, making mp games even more prone to hax.
Thoughts?

I was battling a Fearow on Black in the wild (Route 15). I used an electric move on it and that's when it came with its ability: Lightning Rod. I didn't really think anything to it until after I KO'd it and battled another Fearow who didn't have Lightning Rod. Is Lightning Rod even an ability for Fearow? I couldn't find anything on serebii about that ability for Fearow. I'm worried in case I KO'd unusual Pokemon because I've not seen another one (with that ability) since!
So is it a hidden ability or something? I don't really know much about abilities, so any help would be appreciated. Thanks!

"16"	"10"	"20140106"	"PN1"	"I apologize if you feel that this is posted to the wrong subreddit. /r/pokemonbattles yielded some traffic but in order to help develop the league, we need to expand to more subreddits where competitive players may have missed it.
If any mods feel that this is not suited for this subreddit, please remove it or notify me. 
Why a new league?
To promote the multibattle format. There is some confusion on how doubles and multibattle differ. The main thing is that it is a 4 player battle divided into teams of two. You also have a total pool of 12 pokemon on each side while bringing 3 each resulting in a 6v6 battle (compared to the 4v4 in doubles). 
What makes you different?
Besides the new format, we want to encourage a better competitive community. Naturally we chose Reddit as it serves as the best collaborative medium to promote discussion, battling, and trading. In order to promote league events, we will offer cash prizes during our premium tournaments (which take place near every 6 months) and monthly prizes for our smaller events. 
Who is sponsoring the event or providing the funding?
I will be funding everything. We are not sponsored or attempting to make any profit off this. No entrance fees or investments. All we ask from our players is simple, play! There are no catches or tricks involved. We just want to promote the format and create a competitive league with professionalism.
What can we expect?
Every tournament or event will be as prepared and efficient as possible. We will be streaming and recording many of the matches via a 3DS capture card. We are hoping to bring in volunteer casters and provide reviews to many of the matches.
As I have held tournaments for various games, we are prepared to handle the traffic and craziness that these events can bring.
Where can I find out more?
Head on over to /r/towerofmastery. We are currently working on getting things set up. You can find our rule set and announcement for the first tournament. If you have any questions, please feel free to send me a message.

The games don't tell you this, and the only comparable item--the Focus Band--lasts indefinitely. I'm pissed off because i just lost mine...so i thought i'd keep other people from making the same mistake.
(It's obviously safe to use it in the PWT, the Battle Frontier/Tower/Subway, and in battles against other humans. In the regular game, on the other hand, when it's gone, it's gone.)

So I first encountered him after the league so I could track him via the pokedex, but from now on, every time I take a look at where he is, I'm trying to reach this route by bycicle / foot because every time I use fly he just run away so I was told to go by any way but fly.
I usually wait at Lumiose city and EVEN if he is on a road next to the city, by the time I arrive here, he is gone like so FAR AWAY !
So how on earth is it possible to meet him? I just tried like 10 times, changing zone at Lumiose City to have him be on a route aside the city but he just run away every time I reach that route... 
I gotta meet him at least 10 times and it's not even been twice, I am desperate... 
Any tips? Thanks.

4618	"Guide: How to reliably catch 3+IV dittos in Gen VI using chaining"	"219"	"89"	"20131209"	"preppypoof"	"Introduction
Hello everyone, I discovered something yesterday and found that it was simply too good not to share. I tried searching around for information to corroborate my findings but have come up empty on anything concrete. The closest thing I found was this comment in the Chaining Tutorial. I haven't really thought much of it since then, but I've come to confirm that YES, having a long chain with the Poke Radar DOES improve the IVs of the Pokemon that you catch!
Quick Aside
If you haven't heard of chaining, I highly recommend heading over to the delightful Chaining Tutorial by /u/Cpctheman. This guide will assume that you already know how to chain using the Poke Radar, though I am happy to answer any questions about chaining in the comments below.
My Findings
As I said before, there is a direct correlation between your current chain on the Poke Radar and the IVs of the Pokemon that you encounter:


Current Chain
Guaranteed Perfect IVs



1 - 20
Zero


21 - 40
One


41 - 60
Two


61+
Three


I know what you may be thinking. Sixty-one? How am I supposed to chain that high! I admit that the task seems daunting. However, the only place to catch dittos in the wild (i.e. not the Friend Safari, where the Poke Radar doesn't work) is in Pokemon Village (the grassy area at the end of route 20). Pokemon Village is a chaining dream. The grassy patches are so wide open that it's very easy to obtain long chains. I haven't been attempting this for too long (like I said, I just discovered this recently) but my longest streak so far is 119. That's a lot of 3+IV dittos!
Note: catching a shiny ditto does NOT reset your chain. I'm not sure that it's possible to catch another shiny Pokemon on the same chain, but every Pokemon that you encounter after your shiny will still have the perfect IVs according to the chart above.
Tips, Tricks, and other info
My method for catching 3+IV dittos is as follows. I get my chain up to 60 by simply fainting the dittos in the wild. It takes a lot less time than catching every single one, and once the chain is at 60 then every subsequent ditto will have at least 3 IVs anyway, so I don't really waste my time catching anything until then (unless there's a shiny, of course!). The easiest way to keep track of your chain is to count the PP of the Pokemon that you are using to faint the dittos. For example, my Kanghaskan has 40PP worth of moves that can faint ditto in one hit. Once all of those moves are gone, I know that I've fainted forty dittos. Side note: you can use items such as ether, elixir, or berries, or use PP restoring power during your chain and your chain won't break. I promise. Once you get your chain to above 60, it's a little trickier to count your chain because you'll be trying to catch every ditto, but it doesn't really matter because all you care about is that your chain is above 60. It usually takes me about 35-40 minutes to build up a chain to 60.
edit: you can close your 3DS and/or press the home button and it won't break the chain. i'm not sure what else you can do besides that, but I'm positive of these things!
The Pokemon that I use for catching Dittos is a Smeargle with False Swipe, Spore, Gastro Acid, and Soak (guide here). It's pretty annoying when the opposing ditto goes first and uses Spore, but other than that this is a foolproof method of catching ditto. The only downside is that my Smeargle is really high level (around 90) and even then the ditto will have more than 1HP with a false swipe every once in a while. So if you don't already have a Smeargle like this, you may want to use a different Pokemon as your catcher. But I would definitely recommend false swipe and a status move at the very least. Also, unless it's nighttime in your game, I believe that the Repeat Ball (3x catch rate) is your best option for catching dittos. Otherwise, use a Dusk Ball (3.5x catch rate).
Lastly, I'll include a way to easily check the IVs of the dittos you have captured. This is a method of classifying your dittos that takes a lot less time than talking to the IV checker. Similar to the ""eye-V check"" guide, you can simply look at ditto's stats and know with some certainty what his perfect IVs are. Here is a table with the numbers to look out for:


Stat
Hindering Nature
Neutral Nature
Helpful Nature



HP (level 48)
118
118
118


Others (level 48)
58
65
71


HP (level 49)
121
121
121


Others (level 49)
60
67
73


Unfortunately, the stats for level 48 can only ensure you that the IV is at least 29. So if you get a neutral natured ditto with stats of 118/65/65/65/65/65, you don't necessarily have a 6IV perfect ditto - you need to talk to the IV checker guy. However, if you get a level 49 neutral natured 121/67/67/67/67/67, congratulations: you just won the ditto lottery. Those are definitely perfect IVs!
Thanks everyone, I hope this helps! Let me know if there is anything that needs clarifying, or if you have any questions about chaining in general!

After hours of hard work, I finally got my perfect 5 IV Charmander, bred for Charizard X, with Outrage, Flare Blitz, and Dragon Dance
But then I realized just how many more pokemons i have to breed...
Tyranitar, Garchomp, Excadrill, Dragonite, Aegislash, Skarmory, the list goes on and on
Is it really worth it to IV breed EVERY pokemon? would it be sufficient to breed pokemons based on their purposes? For example for Skarmory, would be enough to just IV breed for Def and Sp. Def, and EV train the rest? Breeding is quite tedious and i really dont want to go through the same process again...
Speaking of EV training, does anybody have a pokemon with pokerus that i can borrow? (Friend Code: 0104-0599-6292)
Also, how exactly would i build a team around Charizard? I know i need to get excadrill with rapid spin to get rid of hazards but thats pretty much all i know(sorry, kind of noob to competitive pokemon)
thanks guys!

Obviously, this idea is based off two assumptions.

I submit it here, freely, in the hope that they decide to make it reality...
We need a Pokemon game app for smart phones (both Apple and Android). The app would allow our phones to turn each of us into a Pokemon trainer is a MMORPG set in the real world.
It would work like this...
Just like the original Pokemon game, you would get your choice of a starter Pokemon, and then you would begin your journey.
Utilizing the GPS built into smartphones (or via Wifi for iPod touch), the app would track your whereabouts and spontaneously and occasionally alert you to the presence of a wild Pokemon that you can attempt to capture or fight. Here's where the greatness really kicks in... because your device has an idea of where you are, it can present you with particular Pokemon in particular areas.
Consider, for instance, that you are walking through the suburbs. Most likely, you will be encountering Pidgey, Rattata, Spearow, Weedle, etc. Maybe a Meowth here and there. When you are in an industrial area, you might be more likely to encounter Koffing. Near a cemetery? Well, you might just encounter a Ghastly or a Cubone. (Clearly I haven't played any Pokemon since the line-up expanded beyond 151, but you get the idea).
It gets even better. Nintendo could design brand new Pokemon that are distinct to certain cities or areas of the world. There might be distinct new Pokemon waiting for you as you approach the subways of New York City, as you hike the Grand Canyon, or as you visit the tide pools of the Northern California coast.
The game would still, of course, allow for players to battle one another, both remotely and when nearby. I imagine that players fighting their Pokemon over the internet would battle in a neutral virtual zone, but that when battling in close real-life proximity, the setting of the battle might change to reflect the real environment, giving different Pokemon different advantages and disadvantages. For example, your level 13 Staryu might stand a better chance when fighting near the shore.
Finally, I imagine that the ""Gym"" system could be a lot of fun. The various gym leaders could only be fought while present in specific cities or states. More than that, the real-world could be broken down into so many various parcels of territory, each with its own gym leader. The kicker would be that the gym leader in each territory would actually be a real person who lives in the area (i.e. their phone checks in to the area a minimum number of times a month). It would be like the Mayor feature in Foursquare, except that it would be earned not just by repeated presence, but by maintaining the best record in the area.
So, Nintendo, I offer you this idea at no cost. You owe it to yourselves and the world to make it a reality.
And if you really want to pay me, I would accept the cash. You're welcome.
EDIT: A few additions...

For those who don't travel much, there could even be an advantage to staying in one place for most of the time. Perhaps your Pokemon would have a certain level of homefield advantage in combat when you were in that area. 
Some of the Pokemon could even have migratory patterns throughout the year, so that different areas would end up with access to more Pokemon species
While I think having some Pokemon unique to certain places would be great, it would be important to keep it balanced so that a person in just one would region would be able to get a potentially winning team.
It might also be a good idea to have some Pokemon that only appear to a person who has been consistently in the same general area for a long time, as if it was learning to trust the trainer before appearing.
I am not sure if this would actually be a good idea, but they could incorporate a barcode scanner so that Pokemon and items could be found by scanning barcodes with your phone at the store. Who knows, you might find a Bulbasaur in that bag of onions.

Helioptile's and Litleo's rather nonsensical Electric/Normal typing. All things considered, Normal type is a huge liability. No resistances or Super Effective attacks, as well as a weakness to a very widely used type. Not even the Ghost immunity makes the normal type better. And yet, an increasing amount of Pokemon are being given the Normal type.
It could make sense thematically. If the rumors are true, Steel (Representing Cold Iron) and Poison (Prevalent in Fairy tales) would be the other weakness. Normal type could be just so mundane that it disrupts the fantastical power of fairies with cold hard reality.

Catch a sableye and teach it taunt (forget where sorry)
Train it to a level where it will be able to do decent damage to mew two.
Get a paralyzer who can survive aura sphere and psychic
stock up on whatever balls you want
Find mewtwo in the hidden dungeon
turn 1: paralyze mewtwo
turn two: switch in sableye who is immune to both of mewtwo's attacks
Use night shade until mewtwo's hp is low enough
Use taunt whenever it wears off to prevent recover
In the turns mewtwo is taunted throw whatever balls you want

Combat:

You may pick whether to Attack, Use an Item, or Switch Pokemon
To attack, roll a D4, and use the respective attack.
You can use whatever item you want if you pick that.

Switching Out:

Roll a D6, the result is the Pokemon you send out.
If the selected pokemon is fainted / already out, reroll.
If you are offered to switch out (e.g. opponent fainted) flip a coin. On heads you switch out.

New Moves

When asked if you want to learn a new move, flip a coin. Heads is yes.
Roll a D4 if yes, to find which move is replaced.
For HMs, you still have to roll, but you can pick who learns them.

Catching (Optional)

If you wish to catch a pokemon, flip a coin. On heads you may catch it.
If tails, you may flip a second time. If both are tails you cannot catch it.
Shinies are exempt from this rule. I'm not cruel. :P

We know Pikachu will be in it, and there will probably be 4 or maybe 5 pokemon characters in. I'm really wanting Genesect to replace Lucario. Genesect is in the upcoming movie and is the only Pokemon to have had 2 events in the same generation, so he has definitely had some spotlight. Moving on, since the new mega evolutions are one of the new highlights of X and Y, I was thinking about an idea that is a huge stretch but one that I think is awesome. What if, instead of the old Pokemon Trainer, a Gen 3 trainer (Brendan) came and used a Swampert, a Sceptile, and a Blaziken and you could switch out the same way you could in brawl. Then, for its Final Smash, you could turn into the Mega-Evolution of the pokemon you were using at the time? The reason I think this could happen is because Blaziken got a mega-evo and I think Game Freak will balance out Gen 3 by giving the other starters in (at least) that region Mega Evolutions. Also, there is a possibility that a Hoenn remake could be coming. Finishing up, another person I want in SSB4 is the leader of team Flare. I don't know who he/she is but smash bros needs more villains and it would be sick to have a villain from Pokemon but the only evil things in Pokemon are the rival teams you fight against. Maybe his moves could be him sending out his different pokemon and them using a move or something, I dunno. Who do you guys want in the next Smash bros? I know a lot of people want Newtwo, Zoroark or a horde of relentless Fletchlings, but what else?

In addition to this it would make sense to in this possible Gen III remake that the other 2 special Mega Stones be given to the player after the completion of the Elite 4.

So as I said in my title, I want to use single type teams on the Elite Four.  Not sure how to go about doing this.  My first thoughts are this:
1. Make a survey for everybody to take selecting which pokemon to use.  I will make 18 different surveys with all the pokemon of the type in that survey.  Whichever, I think, 9 pokemon have the most votes will be used.  This is only to ensure that I can easily get all the pokemon I need.**
2. Should I be allowed to use items?  If so, what type of items should I be allowed to use.  Only hold items?  Any items? No items?  Curious as to what your thoughts are.
3. Should I be allowed to use dual types?  If so, how many per team?  As many as I want?
4. What should the levels of my pokemon be?  Should I keep them all at one level, or stagger them like the members of the Elite Four do?
I have a couple rules for sure.  For the survey, I will only do fully evolved pokemon and all will be 5IV, and a solid nature.  I also will not be using any legendaries.  Not sure yet about if I will use HAs.

So I thought of a way to help you guys out obtaining some of your favourite Pokemon from previous generations that are currently unobtainable in X and Y. However, there is one catch, you will need a starter from generations 2, 3, 4 and 5. The method is simple really. Breed a load of previous generation starters, and then offer then on the GTS for anything you may need. This is what I have been doing for the past 3 days and I have managed to obtain all starters from gen 2 to 5, as well as several unobtainables, including Cottonee and Darumaka.
This is the personal method I have been using, and if you want to try this but are at a lack of previous generation starters, send me a PM through Reddit with your friend code, and I can give you a spare Piplup, since I have several boxes full.
Happy catching!

4807	"I had an idea for a Pokemon game, would anyone play this?"	"23"	"27"	"20130902"	"Garlien"	"Now, before people start telling me, I've seen ideas like this before.  I wanted to share this with people who haven't seen these ideas and hopefully give a unique spin of the idea to people who have heard it.  Here goes!
To start off, this would almost definitely have to be an entirely separate console-thing, like the Pokewalker.  This ""console"", which I will call the Pokemon Geo, will have a few requirements.

GPS capabilites.  This one is a must, and is the basis of the entire Pokemon Geo.
Infrared capabilities.  This would allow you to communicate with other players using a Pokemon Geo or even possibly those using their DS or 3DS.
Pedometer capabilities.  This would be a core mechanic of battles and encourage people to carry their Pokemon Geo with them whenever they can.
A way to connect to a computer.  More on this later.

The idea for the Pokemon Geo would be simple, but would have many possibilities.  Upon starting the system, the GPS would boot up and connect to the satellites necessary to find your geographic location.  Once this has been completed, the screen will switch to a background based on the topography, time, and weather of where you are.  There's no real reason to keep the system in this stage, so turn it to sleep mode and start walking around.  When an event occurs, the Pokemon Geo would make a noise or vibrate (customizable by the owner) and the owner would have about 30 seconds to take out the Geo and reactivate it.  It will open a battle with a wild pokemon that fits the time, location, and weather of where you are.  For example, you could find Gravelers in rocky areas, Zubats at night, and Snovers during snowstorms.  You could progress through this battle like normal by using your starter pokemon, or run away.  The wild pokemon's level should be determined by the level of your lead pokemon, so within 10 levels and leaning towards the lower side should do fine.  Doing battle with this wild pokemon would progress just as it would during a regular main series game.  If you chose to run away, this is where steps come into play.  In the game, there are two currencies, Steps and the standard Pokemon game currency.  Using items or running during battle uses steps.  If a player runs out of steps and cannot run from the battle, they must actually start moving around to escape the battle.  The steps required would be something along the lines of the wild pokemon's speed minus your pokemon's speed, with the minimum being ~30 steps.  This would encourage people to save their steps for when they need them, like when they use items, which cost many, many more steps.
Along with finding wild pokemon, walking around saves up steps and gives you a chance to find items instead of pokemon, which can be used to find Pokeballs or rarer items like TM's, which would only be single-use in this game.  Using these items costs steps, forcing players to train or risk losing steps.  Repels could also be found or bought (using steps) to repel wild pokemon for relatively longer than the main series of games.  This would let people have a guaranteed way to get steps without having to worry about running into wild pokemon.
The ways to get regular money in Pokemon Geo would be to sell the items that you find.  This could be done at the Store, which there is a button for on the main screen.  At the store you can also buy Pokeballs, Repels, or other helpful items for a combination of both Steps and regular money.
Here's where we get to the really interesting part.  You know how I said that you find pokemon that fit in your topography, weather, and time?  Well, it also works the other way.  You do not find pokemon that don't fit into those requirements, the most problematic being your topography.  If you live in, say, a dry, desert-like area, there would be an abundance of ground types, but it would be incredibly difficult to get Ice- or Water-types, among others.  The solution to this would be where the connection to your computer comes into play.  You could connect to your Pokemon Geo Online account through a cable that came with the Geo.  For a first time user, they would customize a trainer, create a profile, and sync their Geo.  This must be done almost immediately after receiving the Geo because this Geo Online account works as your PC.  If you catch a pokemon in the wild while you already have 6 pokemon in your party, the pokemon's data is stored so that you can view it, but you cannot use that pokemon until you sync with your account.  Once this is done, the pokemon will be deposited in your PC box, where you can switch it out with a different pokemon to use on your Geo.  Another feature of the Geo Online account is trading.  This is where topography really comes in handy.  If you're living in rural South Dakota, you can find someone living on the Gulf of Mexico or on the Indian Ocean to help balance your team's type coverage.  Trading would work similarly to the way that the GTS works, but they would not be compatible.  If you wanted to have a pokemon on your Geo on one of your DS/3DS games, you'd have to use Infrared Connection to send it on a one-way journey.  Trading wouldn't be allowed between them because this would defeat the purpose of the topography-based pokemon encounters.
Once you have your team balanced to your satisfaction, you can battle.  If you find someone else with a Geo who is willing to battle, you battle via Infrared Connection.  You can also battle via Geo Online, where the battle options are on the Geo and the battle is displayed on the screen of your computer, making a good computer-based battle simulator.  Meeting these people by battling can open up new possibilities for you as well, as they might have caught a rare pokemon or been to a different area where they have more pokemon they can catch.  Winning a battle will earn you standard currency.  Battles can also take place between a Geo and the main series of games via Infrared Connection.  The main differences would be that Items have the option to be used during Geo Online battles at the cost of higher rates of steps, but in Main Series battles, Items will be automatically turned off and you will not earn money for winning.
The final set of long-winded ideas for this game would be events.  Similar to weather, or even the same thing, these events take place every once in a while.  For example, a meteor shower in your area will allow you to catch uncommon pokemon like Clefairy or incredibly rare ones like Deoxys, for about 3 days after they happen.  Castforms could pop up in areas that have been ravaged by tornadoes, thunderstorms, and hurricanes (I could imagine pulling out my Geo in the middle of ~100 mph winds in a tornado).  This would encourage trading even more between people, even people that live in your area, due to the chance that they caught an even pokemon that you missed.  Non-natural events could be things like promotions, where say a store like GameStop has a place to plug in your Geo to have the chance of finding rare pokemon, like legendaries that might not be found normally.  These could go alongside or even replace the game-based events that just straight up give you the pokemon by adding some randomness and possibly the chance to have a rare ability or special move.  Events could also be more minor, like smaller stores that want more business could pay you a small amount of steps for visiting their stores, essentially cheap advertisement.  When 6th generation is released, which it would be if this game were to ever happen, you could occasionally find Mega Stones that would be unobtainable in-game, or find a pokemon that has their Dream World ability.  The Geo would also have a built-in daycare, which would be accessible similarly to the shop, but would require many steps to actually hatch a pokemon, something like the number in the main games, for the benefit of having a higher chance of having good IVs, a hidden nature, or some other small advantage.
The system would also have some peripherals.  There could be belt-strap bags for holding the Geo or a wallet, a purse with a similar function, and Geo Skins.  When you receive your Geo, it would have a standard case (probably a poke ball pattern), but you could buy and replace cases to customize your Geo as you wish.  The final peripheral would be a standalone pedometer that you could carry with you instead of heaving around the bulk of the Geo so that you can have risk-free steps while needing to carry less weight.  The steps would be transferred to the Geo via the cable that the Geo uses to connect to your Geo Online account.
TL;DR  Most of you are probably reading this.  The idea is that the game is similar to the Pokewalker, but you catch pokemon specific to your topographical region and trade them with people living in other regions.

Will probably CG this some time in the future, but right now I'm just happy I drew anything at all!
So I bought a new sketchbook today and I haven't drawn anything for months (horrible art block). So I decided to just draw a mega evolution of a pokemon I thought could be developed more aesthetically. So I went with Mew!
I wanted it to resemble Mewtwo in some way and I also wanted it to look a little more mature. I'm probably gonna work on some more details and enhance some things I'm not satisifed with when I CG it.
Mega Mews ears are supposed to be bigger but I'm not sure if I succeeded with that. And the blue hue in it's tail thingies are meant to look like there's water/bubbles in there, might change it from blue to red though.
I also wanted to make it's eyes lighter, almost as if they're not fully developed to keep that fetus feeling.
That thing coming out of it's forehead goes into the body near where it's usual tail starts, they're somewhat connected.
Bad explanation but I just wanted to share!

Story Line. Pokemon games could go a long way if they step back from the same exact story pattern every game. Yes, the objects and variables are different but the end result is always alike. Continuing to thwart the plans of the enemy every single time does not seem to cut it anymore and the games lack a rush or hype to it. It's not like you feel obligated to just go to the next boss fight anymore, it becomes more of a dragged out process that takes away from defeating the gyms. 
The comparison: Pokemon SnakeWood: Just recently finished this hack and I got to say it was amazing, glitchy but amazing. It helped give me that rush and excitement that i used to get when playing pokemon (when the storyline seemed good to a younger version of me) and i loved every second of it (except for VBA crashes). But, this was a a simple hack and yet its storyline was far superior to that of any pokemon game ever. Yes, it was kind of a parody and was about zombies, but if GameFreak and nitendo could make their story line suspenseful in any way as was snakewoods i would really love to see it and i think it would reignite a lot of old fan's passion for the game. 
Conclusion"" Having a better more unique storyline would be great in pokemon maybe even different story paths (only ever happened in sapphire and ruby if i recall) would make this game succeed in various ways.
The Story should almost be that of an anime or manga or console game where there is character development, suspense, a lot of puzzles and challenges, a hard to read ending (you wont go into the game knowing how it will end or having an easy enough idea of) villain switching or multiple villains and relations importance (make your family in trouble in something or create emotional attachments) 
Tl;dr: it may just be a pokemon game but it should have more story almost like a console game, manga, or anime, snakewood is a great example
Please give me your thoughts and ideas below _^

I recently decided to restart my game and play a Nuzlocke while I still had my Pokebank trial. I sent all my Pokemon into Pokebank, restarted the game, and transferred them back. When I went to organize my Pokemon, I noticed 10 Pokemon missing. 5 of them were competitive Pokemon that took me FOREVER to breed and train (my only 5 competitive Pokemon). 5 of them were Pokemon that I used in my normal playthrough that I had grown pretty attached to (for pixels, ya know) and were almost level 100. I'M SO PISSED OFF RIGHT NOW! The only Pokemon I have that I'm attached to (until I start my Nuzlocke) is my poor Vinnie the Venusaur.
TL;DR: Double check your PC before you restart your game.

My name is Usama Khan and I have been a Pokemon fan for as long as I can remember. Being a Gen 1er, I have had Pokemon in my life for a long time.

This is why I decided to create /r/PokemonBattleArena, a subreddit designed to be the hub for all to use to challenge and battle other Pokemon Trainers.

I already have my friend /u/Mr_Liu, creator of /r/friendsafari, on board to help me, but we still need a lot more help! This is why I am calling out to you all in the Pokemon community for help. If you are interested, read the following requirements and application guideline before submitting one of your own!

"23"	"79"	"20140113"	"eternalquiet"	"I've been playing Pokemon for a long time now (started with Blue back in the day, and have played every generation but V), and until very recently I've never put a lot of thought into how I'd build my team.  I've always just gone for whichever Pokemon I thought were the coolest.  This has never yielded poor results, in terms of getting through the games, but looking back I've come to realize how terrible my teams would actually have been for competitive play.  
These days I'd say I'm more serious about making good teams that I used to be, but I'm still not as hardcore about it as a lot of the people I know or have seen on this subreddit.  I still go for the Pokemon I think are the coolest, but I find that I spend more time actually looking at the abilities, moves, natures, and EVs when trying to build parties.  I spend more time making sure their EVs complement their strengths or shore up their weaknesses, and I try to go for move sets which complement their teammates (like having Sableye with Will-o-Wisp setting up a status for Ninetales Hex to capitalize upon).  
But what about you?  Do you find that you just pick whichever Pokemon are the coolest or the cutest?  Do you like to go for a theme in terms of type, or looks?  Do you not give a whit about how the Pokemon look, and instead focus strictly on which ones have the best stats?  Do you try to go for teams that specialize in entry hazards and forced-switching, or that excel at defense or sweeping?  
tl;dr -- when you're making a team, what are the things you consider most important?

I remember the Mewtwo movie quite well and they kept his cloning lore intact iirc, so we know the technology is there.
Also in the same episode, there are a total of 4 characters, two of which are part of this insane cloning program. Not a single other person is seen in the town or the Pokemon Centre. Is there some kind of population problem that has caused the cloning?
Another point from the same episode: Ash's mother says something like ""Your father will be so proud"" or something that implies he's not around but still alive. Is there some kind of secret war going on that requires everyone to leave? Did the government put this cloning program into place to account for this? A war is never mentioned, hence why I say a ""secret"" war.
And what's with the insane practice of sending ten year old children out on a life-threatening journey with Pokemon? Is this whole thing some kind of military training initiative?
Just what the fuck is going on? This is a surprisingly fucked up universe. I don't remember the games being like this.

Caps isn't used for everything anymore. There is appropriate capitalization.
Pokemon center has a Pokemart built into it.
TM's have infinite uses.
You get a fresh water the first time you go to a new gym.
You can get all the fossil pokemon without having to trade.

This is actually my first post so if I am doing something 'wrong' for some reason... I don't know what it is. I do know Pokemon, though, I've been playing since yellow.
Anyway, my favorites (least to greatest):
5. G4/Sinnoh: this gen, looking back, was really disappointing. Sure, it introduced the double screens and wireless stuff, but the storyline was kinda weird and overly complex, and so were the Pokemon. I did like the new evolutions they added for old Pokemon; tangrowth and rhyperior are awesome.
[tie] 3/4: G3/G5: I honestly cannot decide. Hoenn was creative and pretty different from the first two games, but I've alway thought g3 pokemon to be pretty bizarre. Nonetheless, as video games, rse were awesome additions.
BW were also awesome games, and BW2 were even better. I especially enjoyed the fact that BW included no new Pokemon before the nat dex (no zubat). They felt fresh, but it just wasn't as exciting as the first two.
2. G1/Kanto: Don't get me wrong, I love me some yellow version. Looking back, G1 was absolutely amazing, what with translating something so radical into such a popular game. I love everything about G1, (Nidoking is my favorite all-time) and the remakes were awesome,but...
1. G2: Johto: I, for one, believe G2 did everything G1 did well, better. It was a perfect sequel. Cool new Pokemon (but not too many), an awesome new region (with the chance to go back to Kanto), and a cool 2-years-later story hook. Plus, the remakes were probably the best made games, with perfect use of the touch screen and cool new features. 
Anyway, that's my opinion (and also a way to procrastinate homework..). What's yours?

I had run into some trouble with it when I started in early February because I hadn't caught a Spheal yet, and I'd have to wait until April started to catch one due to the silly season mechanism. Worse, I couldn't just trade for it because I hadn't encountered a trainer with one in the main quest. However, I had seen a Walrein, so I threw a spare Totodile onto the GTS (I've been keeping sets of the starters for a while now for just such an occasion) and hoped for the best. (I'm trying not to use too many shortcuts, although I do have my Join Avenue set up for fast leveling and EV training.)
I just pulled down the Walrein, thanks to some dude named JeremyD. If you're a redditor, JeremyD, then my hat goes off to you. If not, then, well... it's just kind of awesome that a random-ass trade like a Totodile for a Walrein actually happened.

I was thinking that there should be pokemon-specific effects for moves. For examplem pin missle could do 4x damage to Drifloon and Drifblim. Lick could do 2x damage against the Vanillish line, and Bite could do 4x but also have recoil damage. Flash, Scary Face, and other visual moves could not affect Zubat and other pokemon that lack eyes, Screech, Growl, and other sound-based moves could not affect pokemon that lack ears, and Sweet-Scent and other smell-based moves could not affect pokemon that lack noses.
What do you think?

5080	"[Meta] We Seriously Need to Talk About Professor Oak..."	"19"	"2"	"20140303"	"larfleece"	"So I was watching the first season of Pokemon with my friend, and he and  I just made the realization that Professor Oak is basically Krieger from Archer. Think about it, at the beginning of Ash's journey he's suckering kids that are only 9 or 10 (too young to understand the world yet) into thinking there are only 150 Pokemon that are known and these kids need to take his Pokedex and go discover new Pokemon and catch them whereupon they get sent to his lab. Every time Ash goes to a new region and sees new Pokemon first thing he does is catch some that get sent to Professor Oak. Each time, Ash goes in not knowing anything about these new Pokemon and when he goes and talks to Professor Oak, that cheeky bastard seems to have known all along about ALL these Pokemon that fall outside the supposed known 150.
Basically, Professor Oak is a shady con-artist/mad scientist who performs sketchy experiments on the Pokemon that get sent to his lab (odd they go there and not to Bill's PC). He tricks kids into travelling the world and gathering Pokemon for him, which basically seems like the sort of thing Krieger would do if Pokemon and Archer ever did some really weird cross-over.

I used to EV train solely by punching bags, but I've discovered that horde training really is faster. I'm not even using the specific bracers, just a default Macho Brace and Pokerus.
The problem though is that most of my party was dedicated to it. Combee for sweet scent, a pokemon to fly around in, another pokemon to use Earthquake and Rock Slide. 
Tropius really fixes all this though. Our Grass/Flying friend here learns all the moves necessary for victory. 

Tropius's Horde Set


Fly
Sweet Scent
Earthquake
Razor Leaf

Tropius learns Razor leaf and Sweet scent naturally (before level 45). Razor Leaf is his main STAB, not to mention it boosts a nice hefty PP amount of 25 (Earthquake is only 10 by default). If they resist Razor Leaf, then Earthquake will hit the rest. Fly and Sweet Scent are there to free up more party slots so you can get back to training more pokemon at the same time. 
Tropius might take a few levels higher to be useful against some of the high end hordes (Arbok hordes spamming intimidate make Earthquake a 2 Hit KO @ 45). Against level 25 and under hordes though and he's a beast. 
Figured I'd share!

I have no qualms about buying it used, but I want to resort to a site like eBay as a last resort as I don't quite trust getting used games on it. On the other hand, Amazon has it listed for $73 and that is way higher than I want to pay for it.

It's more than half of the mega evolutions that get this. I don't know if this is intentional or accidental but i thought i'd ask what /r/pokemon thinks of this. Tell me if you think it's intentional or not, what it could mean, etc. Here's a list of all the mega's that get an extra red detail upon mega-evolving:

Venusaur - He get's a pink flower on his head. I don't know if i can count this.
Charizard X - His eyes become red.
Charizard Y - Stays exactly the same as regular charizard color wise.
Blastoise - His eyes become red too.
Alakazam - There's a red gem on his forehead.
Gengar - The lower parts of his body, that stick in the ground become more of a pink than the purple on the rest of his body.
Kangaskhan - The baby has red eyes which he hasn't in kangaskhan's regular form.
Pinsir - Nothing, he get's orange details, but i'm not gonna count that.
Gyarados - Red spots and a red stripe along his body.
Mewtwo X - No red details added at all.
Mewtwo Y - His eyes become red as well.
Ampharos - Red gems in the hair on his tail. He already has one of these gems on his head and at the tip of his tail in his normal form.
Scizor - Red all over, before and after mega-evolving.
Heracross - Reddish lines around his joints and a reddish spot on his forehead. It's more of an orange but oh well.
Houndoom - His eyes were already red before mega evolving, but his nails get red as well in his mega-form.
Tyranitar - Get's 2 small red spots on his chest and his lower belly turns red too (the part that's blue in his regular form).
Blaziken - Already is red pretty much all over.
Gardevoir - Get's an extra red detail in the chest, not too noticeable.
Mawile - His legs get purple as well as the tip of his arms.
Aggron - Nothing.
Medicham - Has pink details before and after mega evolving, but doesn'te get any extra.
Manectric - His eyes were already red before mega evolving, but his nails get red as well in his mega-form, just like Houndoom.
Banette - The arms/legs that come out of the outer part of banette are pink.
Absol - Red eyes, but he has those already before mega-evolving.
Garchomp - Get's red details on his axe-claws, and 2 red spikes on his knees.
Lucario - His hands/feet turn red, as well as the tip of his 'hair', or whatever it's called.
Abomasnow - Nothing.

TL;DR: I noticed a lot of mega evolutions having red (or reddish) details added upon mega-evolving. I made a list of all mega-evolutions and ask what you think.

5187	"[Fluff] Hey there r/Pokemon, so, I've been keeping a sort of journal/story going for a Pokemon Ruby Randomizer Nuzlock Challange I'm doing. Would there be any interest in reading it so far? Or is this the wrong place to put stuff like this?"	"6"	"5"	"20140317"	"Fox--Kit"	"So, I see that self-posts are gone, and I'm not sure if this is what this is or not, but it's also not ""Art"" per say....If this is the wrong place for this to go, just let me know and I'll delete it and I guess try to figure out where else it'll go then. 
ANYWAY:
So, I've never really visited r/pokemon before, but I do enjoy seeing it on the front page. I'm a big fan of pokemon but haven't played it as much in recent years (most recent was SoulSilver). I've basically been watching/keeping track of TwitchPlaysPokemon (and it's subreddit) every single day since Day 3 or so of Red, and it's really taken hold of me and gotten me back into wanting to play the games again. 
This time though, I thought I'd do something different. Ruby is my favorite game since it's the one I've played the most (like, 355 hours or so before the cartridge batter died and now it's all erased. T ^ T) and so I've downloaded the Ruby rom and I'm playing a pokemon randomizer. The options selected are only random starters and wild pokemon and I also removed trade evolutions. All moves, tms, items, stats, natures etc. are the same because I wanted a more cohesive experience rather than one an off the wall one.
I have days 1-4 so far written so far--about 11,000 words--and would like to keep updating it as much as possible (I currently don't have a job T-T, but I have one lined up for during the summer. Point is I have a lot of free time so I thought I'd write something). I'm mainly writing this for myself, but I was wondering if there'd be any interest in anyone else reading it. I've always found them fun to read and stuff myself.  
Anyway, enough rambling. Thoughts?

I'm having fun so far but, yeah, it's too easy (even without exp share). So I'm trying to think of ways of making the game harder and more interesting, other than nuzlocking. Here's mine, it's inspired by the way Ash loses all of his Pokemon except Pikachu when entering a new area so I'm calling it Ash Ketchum mode.
Every time you beat a gym, you must box five of your Pokemon before moving on. The one you keep is your ""Starter"". From then on, you're only allowed to capture Pokemon that are on the path directly between the gym you beat and the gym you're going to (you're allowed to capture Pokemon that are on routes you've previously visited if they're on that direct route). Once you beat the last gym, you're allowed to assemble your team from all the previous Pokemon, train them up, and then go after the Elite Four.
So what this means is you'll always have that experience of catching Pokemon to build your team. You'll get to discover a lot of Pokemon that you'd normally dismiss and you'd lower the risk of over-leveling your Pokemon I think it could be pretty fun, at least for the type of player like me who's between being new to the games and knowing every Pokemon by heart. 
Variations include: No starter, as soon as you catch your first Pokemon from the new area, you have to go and switch your last pokemon from the last area for the first pokemon of the new area.
Forced starter: If you encounter a free Pokemon (like getting Lapras in Silph Co. or the Gen 1 starters in Lumiose City), you must box them and then use them as your starter for the next area.
This could be interesting for randomizer runs too, if you put a limit on the number of Pokemon you can catch or encounter.
So, is it any good? Any suggestions for making it better?

I think the Pokemon league pays anyone who is a trainer/breeder/pokemon owner a set amount of special money to buy equipment necessary like potions and pokeballs and stuff, and it's only Poke Marts and certain places that take it. We never actually seem to spend the money on anything except stuff for our Pokemon, so this kinda makes sense.
I know in some generations you can buy drinks and stuff, but maybe the money also covers select places that trainers can go to eat/drink, and businesses can sign up to accept the money, and the league converts it to real money for them.

5264	"Parfum Palace Speculation"	"12"	"4"	"20140331"	"Ultrateon"	"I had given up on playing Pokemon, so I only just heard about the Parfum Palace mystery... I read up on it and I find it very interesting. I thought of an interesting possible solution and I'd like to share it:
Rotate the image of the garden by 180 degrees (or pi radians, if that's how you roll) (No justification for this. Actually do it in paint or your program of choice though, since seeing it will make my post much easier to comprehend.)
The hedge in which Furfrou is chased now seems to resemble a ghost type pokemon with a scary face. But forget about that just now. Focus on the other hedges.
-Top left is now resembling Cacturne instead of Pyroar (especially the shape of the head fits perfectly).
-Bottom left is still Solrock due to his symmetric-ass design.
-Top left is now METAGROSS (and not Chandelure).
-Bottom right, I believe, is Duskull. (or a ghost type.) Why?
I think the rotated version of the Parfum Palace Garden is a super-effective chain in an N-shaped formation. Bottom left is super effective on top left, top left is super effective on bottom right, and that's super effective on top right.
I can't tell you why I believe it's an N-shaped formation besides the fact that the vertical lines seemed to direct me towards that formation as opposed to a rectangle - they almost seem to me as if they cut off any rectangular lines you could draw.
The N-cycle seems to work as follows:
Solrock (FIRE, rock) is super effective on Cacturne. Cacturne (DARK, grass) is super effective on the ghost in the bottom right. The ghost pokemon is then super effective against Metagross (steel, PSYCHIC).
Obviously I still don't know what that hedge is, BUT if we believe the above cycle to be correct, then we have incidentally only got 3rd gen pokemon in the cycle, and I'd expect that to continue with that ghost type.
Saving you some time - all the 3rd gen ghost types: Shedinja, Sableye, Shuppet, Banette, Duskull and Dusclops. 
Since the others have all had two types, this ghost pokemon may also be a double-typed one (like shedinja, who is bug and ghost.
I wish I paid some attention to B&W, but I didn't. However, the N formation may be explained by someone who knows about N from B&W. I mean, the N-shaped cycle seems to make a lot of sense in retrospect, given Zekrom and Reshiram (legendaries of B&W) are there in statue form.
NOTE: This also works if you flip the image upside down instead of rotating it 180 degs, but the order & positions of pokemon will be different. The N-cycle still holds, however.

*EDIT: The N-Cycle seems to be continuous as well, since Metagross (STEEL, psychic) is super effective against Solrock (ROCK, psychic).
It might be Farfetch'd... but I think I may possibly be onto something. I just hope it might inspire someone else at the very least.

*EDIT2: And if this somehow works out... HOENN REMAKE CONFIRMED (all pokemon are gen 3).

This was received with mixed reactions, but I'm wondering what you guys think about the idea? Like, I'm thinking that it requires a level 100 Pokemon to enter it, and would scale according to that, so 101 being the equivalent to something like level 1 in regular game, and so on. Keep in mind, this wouldn't remove any of the post-game content already in the game, just compliment it.

Well I have just the solution! You roleplay it on the internet. Why? Because Wynaut?
We're a beginning roleplaying community, although everyone who's posted so far has plenty of experience doing so. You start out in either Kanto or Johto (We're working on the rest), get either Bulbasaur, Charmander or Squirtle if you start in Kanto or Chikorita, Cyndaquil and Totodile if you start in Johto, and you travel around the Pokemon World being anything your heart desires, whether it's the bread-and-butter Trainer, the elegant Co-ordinator, the graceful Connoisseur or the daring Ranger. Hell, we even have a miner.
Now, there are a few things to keep in mind. There's a wiki, and the moderators will stick to it like glue. You have to level up your Pokemon by questing and you can only find the Pokemon indicated on the Wiki to be present in the area you're in (so no finding Scizors in Ilex Forest, for example). Also legendaries (all of them) are a no go (and this will NOT change). But apart from that, it's sure to be a lot of fun times for all!
Hope to see you guys there,
CrazyMyrmidon

-Korrina and The tower of Mastery both take a big role in Mega evolution
-theres a few powerplant-like buildings in the Kalos dessert.
-Team flare want money.
[EVERYTHING PAST HERE IS SPECULATION AND NOT TO BE TAKEN AS FACT]
I believe that After beating Korrina, who will be a later gym leader (possibly last) and after beating her she gives you a key to enter The tower of mastery. Probably because she sees your a trainer with a special bond with your Pokemon or something long those lines. 
Once in the tower I think it'll be something along the lines of Black tower/white tree hollow, and after clearing all trainers on each floor (let's say 5) you face the ""leader of each floor and there mega pokemon. There will possible be a floor for each mega evolution if there aren't too many. 
Once at the top of the tower you are gifted with the mega stone for each pokemon you faced in the tower. Or, as that seems a bit too much, a pokemon (let's say mewtwo) and its corresponding mega stone. 
Now team flare come into the theory. The powerplats in the desserts are maybe team flares HQ, and I think they're digging for mega stones to make their captured Mewtwo stronger. 
The pods and things east of them are, I think, drills and are collecting rocks. The castle thingy southernmost in the dessert, east from the tower is where there main base of operations is. The tower/spire is a detainment facility where Mewtwo is kept at the peak. The fans could be powering the whole thing or might not, I couldn't give a shit about the fans. I hate them.
I think after the player and game mascot stops team flare while Professor Sycamore and the opposite game mascot takes care of mewtwo, you meet with him battle and he gives you... Nothing. He takes the mewtwo because you're a 15 year old child that shouldn't take care of god-like monster especially when it is in it's mega form and could crush the whole of Kalos with its pinky. 
However once you beat the E4 you're given mewtwo by prof. S because now you're special.

RULES:
-CAN NOT buy pokeballs of any kind
-Pokeballs found on the floor are allowed to be used (Edit#3: Ability pick up to find pokeballs includes finding on the floor)
-Pokemon you capture is part of your team (if extra in box)
-If used all first 5 pokeballs on first pokemon you encounter you CAN 
  NOT buy more pokeballs for second chances
-You can take chance on catching legendaries but only with the 
  pokeballs you have
Edit#1:-Gift pokemon in the game are acceptable to have a part of your team
Edit#2:-Eggs/putting pokemon in the daycare to make eggs are also acceptable

I haven't came up for a name for this challenge but be free to throw in ideas.

Another time was when I let her play on my Sapphire for a few minutes. During a battle, she turned to me and said ""These graphics suck.""
Lastly, I was talking on the phone with her and asked her if she was ever going to get a gen 4 game. She said no and gave me three ""reasons"" why
1. You could only use TMs once
2. She was convinced that wild pokemon could run away from you. (She had no idea what a safari zone was.)
3. The pokemon sprites in battles didn't move.

So here's the thing, I've always been a fan of Pokemon, but I really haven't been very involved since about...Ruby/Sapphire, so it's been awhile. I would like to get back into it, and kind of on the more competitive side of it, but I'm kind of lost. 
There's so much new info that either wasn't around with me, or I didn't pay attention to because I was younger. IV's, items being held, natures, passive effects, I don't really know what most of it even is. The only thing I really know about is which types are effective/resistant to each other, and even my knowledge on that is probably outdated. 
I was wondering if anyone could catch me up to speed on what's new with the battling world, or at least point me to a good place where I can find this all in an easy to read format. I would be very appreciative, thank you for taking time to read thing. 
TL;DR Pretend I've never played Pokemon before, catch me up to speed on battling competitively or direct me to a nice place to find it, please.
Thanks in advance.

Though everything's nice and all, I just realized that I've got a huge amount of TMs piled up and never managed to teach them to my Pokemon. Would anyone help me teach them to correct Pokemon so that I won't end up having a Pokemon learn that same attack in its learnset and so on?
Here's my list of oft-used Pokemon:
Lv.51 Croconaw - Ice Fang, Crunch, Hydro Cannon, Agility
Lv.51 Alakazam - Teleport, Psychic, Future Sight, Disable
Lv.49 Dragonair(in-training to become Dragonite) - Dragon Rage, Draco Meteor, Dragon Rush, Aqua Tail
Lv.40 Gyarados(sorta HM Slave) - Ice Fang, Waterfall, Whirflpool, Surf
Lv.51 Golem(same here) - Strength, Earthquake, Rock Smash, Stone Edge
Lv.50 Hitmonlee - Hi Jump Kick, Endure, Blaze Kick, Mega Kick
Lv.50 Dewgong - Sheer Cold, Rest, Aqua Tail, Ice Beam
Lv.57 Electrode - Flash, Charge Beam, Swift, Screech
Lv.14 Eevee(I'm waiting for a Fire Stone to make her a Flareon due to my lack of Fire Pokemon BUT DAMNED SCHOOL BOY ALAN NEVER CALLS) - Tail Whip, Tackle, Helping Hand, Sand Attack
Lv.32 Ampharos - Thunder Punch, Cotton Spore, ThunderShock, Thunder Wave
Lv.38 Raticate - Hyper Fang, Sucker Punch, Scary Face, Crunch
Lv.36 Pidgeot - Whirlwind, Quick Attack, Gust, FeatherDance
Lv.14 Togepi(never got around leveling him) - Sweet Kiss, Charm, Extrasensory, Metronome
Lv.29 Golbat - Bite, Wing Attack, Confuse Ray, Mean Look
That's my team, and though I lack some serious types due to Nuzlocke, I love 'em, but I never got around making good move lists.
As for my TMs:
Hail, Sunny Day, Hyper Beam, SolarBeam, Iron Tail, Earthquake, Return, Psychic, Shadow Ball, Shock Wave, Sludge Bomb, Sandstorm, Fire Blast, Aerial Ace, Torment, Rest, Attract, Thief, Snatch, False Swipe(I've got a Krabby who knows it though), Dragon Pulse, Drain Punch, Silver Wind, Embargo, Shadow Claw, Payback, Avalanche, Dark Pulse, Sleep Talk, Swagger, Pluck.
I know this is a pretty lengthy list, but I really hope you guys can help me.

I was thinking about past games and what they had included, and I thought of Red. I think there should be a battle between you and Hilbert in Black 2 and White 2.
You could find him at the top of Dragonspiral Tower after catching Reshiram (W2) or Zekrom (B2). Perhaps there could be a set amount of days after you catch them before he appears. If you used Memory Link and had completed B/W, the gender and name of the character would change accordingly (Hilbert isn't exactly a powerful-sounding name). You would be facing your past self.
Hilbert (I'll call the character Hilbert for the sake of clarity, even though it would most likely have a different name and perhaps gender) would have Emboar, Samurott, and Serperior on his team. He would also have the legendary dragon from the game before yours (Reshiram in B2 and Zekrom in W2). I'm not sure what his last two would be. Perhaps Chandlure and Gigalith, or other powerful Gen V pokemon. His pokemon would all be high levels, in the 80s.
Last but not least, I would like to see this as his battle theme.

I found myself playing up to many hours a day and I loved the storyline. I absolutely loved the ending, it was what got me. I couldn't share my thoughts with my family as they all don't even like pokemon. So, once again, I'm turning to my fellow friends on reddit. I just want to see what all of you think, how do you feel. I really hope that there will be another game as nice as this, and I will definitely buy it without considering. So, what do all of you think?

Is this a matter of chance and all I need to do is soldier on, or should I maybe replace a Pokemon/held item?

5528	"[GUIDE] How to find a legitimate substitute plush and avoid bootlegs."	"18"	"3"	"20140421"	"Stolen_Goods"	"Maybe you saw a blog post on how absolutely adorable the blogger's new substitute plushes are. Maybe you saw a reddit post showing the practical uses of a substitute, one of which being how to skip class without anyone ever knowing. Maybe you saw the Nintendo Direct with Sakurai's sub and decided that you really want what is arguably the best PokeDoll out there. It's not going to be a cakewalk, but it's worth it. Time for some homework, kiddies.

BASIC INFO:
Firstly, it's important to note that there are three different varieties of the substitute in the earthly form.

The small 4"" keychain mascot,
The classic 5.5"" PokeDoll,
And the huggable 12"" plush.

These were all exclusive to Pokemon Centers in Japan, and were sold for a very brief period of time as a part of the Adventure Goods campaign in January 2013. The demand for them was not anticipated and they all sold out within a day, were restocked later in April, and sold out again. Essentially, these are not in production anymore. They are basically on the borderline between being collector's items and just really good plushes. That doesn't mean they're impossible to find, or that they won't be put through for another run sometime, but they won't be cheap.

BOOTLEGS:
There are many, many counterfeit substitutes (or rather, substitutes for substitutes) from bootleggers capitalizing on their popularity and preying on those who can't be bothered to find a legit one. These are often very cheap compared to the legitimate substitutes, but also lower quality. They are commonly found on eBay, so watch your step there. If you really don't care about its legitimacy or if it might look cruddy, then go right ahead and buy one. The following are the common signs of bootlegs:

Shipping from Hong Kong, China, or ""New York."" This is the biggest and by far the most common warning sign. If it ships from any of these places, 99.999% of the time it will be a bootleg.
Uses images found on a lot of other listings but rewatermarked. Example
Is selling for far below what legitimate sellers are selling for or at common bootleg prices (e.g. 12"" subbie for $15)
Plush looks brown-green or has ""sharp""/bad stitching. Prime example
Does not have the whimsicott store tag. Not the best indicator now since many bootleggers have some for images.

EDIT: Bootlegs have been showing up on Amazon as of late for abnormally cheap prices. Always check seller ratings, and if in doubt, NEVER feel pressured to buy.

BUYING INFO:
Any and all on the market are being resold. Again, these are not in production anymore so the number of legitimate-but-still-like-new subs is going to go down eventually until Nintendo gives the green light for another batch (I have my hopes set on a tie-in with Greninja for the SSB release). The current prices are around 2x-5x what they originally sold for.
Common/Average Prices and Store Links:

Keychain Mascot: $23-$25 Amazon Pokevault
5.5"" Pokedoll: $42-50 Amazon Pokevault
12"" Plush: $150-$170 Amazon Pokevault

Any of the links above are ones that I would personally trust myself. It doesn't hurt to get a second opinion on any of this, though, and I would encourage everyone to look for the signs of bootlegging nevertheless. Do note that Amazon listings come and go at a relatively quick pace, so if you see a deal that catches your eye, you're better off going for it as soon as you can because it might not be there when you check a few days later.

OTHER STUFF:
If you're interested in making one by hand, you're going to be on your own. A long Google spree for patterns yielded no results. However, here are some specs courtesy of Pokevault which might be of use:
Material: Polyester.

Height: 5.5"" (14cm) from feet to tip of ears.
Length: 6"" (15.5cm) from nose to tail.
Width: 4.5"" (11.5cm) at widest part.


And that concludes my guide. Feel free to suggest anything for it!

Back around 2008-2009, I was on a trip to Hong Kong, where there is a lot of Pokemon stuff. I remember seeing a game in a street market that was obviously fake, but worked perfectly when I tried it out. This was a fake GBA game in a legitimate looking box but it was clearly not a regular game. The language I believe was English but I'm not too certain. 
I stupidly didn't get to the point where I saw the starter pokemon but I distinctly remember that the box had a sneasel on the front and so did the opening screen. I think the sneasel was taken from the Hoenn series images but I don't remember entirely.
My memory is a bit flawed on the title, but I remember it had something to do with the word ""Black"". It might have been Pokemon Chaos Black, but the images don't fit with the image on Google. I tried looking up Pokemon Black Fake to find a similar image but it's only the actual Pokemon Black.
Can anyone give me any help?
Edit: I made a crappy rendition of what I remember the title screen looked like
I also remember that the sprite for the main character was either the same one for Hoenn or the Fire Red/Leaf Green, although I'm thinking it was the Hoenn one.
Thanks in advance!

Zygarde has this whole Hexagonic theme to it, which reminds me a bit of how data is represented in movies and anime (like digimon a bit). I think that his Zygardite X will look a bit like Xerneas with some ""Zygardic"" additions. I think that Zygarde looks like a flat snake because he is like a parasite that hasn't found a host yet. When he takes over a pokemon, he gets his full power. Zygardite Y will look like Zygarde took control over Yveltal.
Now with the moves: You need to have the move ""Land's wrath"" on you. When you mega evolve with Zygardite X it will become Thousand Arrows (that look like they are shot from Xerneass horns) in order to bring down Yveltal and when you mega evolve with Zygardite Y it will become Thousand Waves (which looks like a strong gust {wings}) so you will be able to trap Xerneas. I also think that there should be a different abillity to each form, to counter the other pokemon.

We start with the probability of a Pokemon being shiny. The normal chance of a Pokemon being shiny is 1/4096. Using the Masuda Method, the chance of a shiny is increased to 3/2048. Last, use of the shiny charm brings the chance up to 1/512. Citation
Next, the chances of an Eevee being born female is 12.5%, or 1/8. Citation
The chances of the mother Pokemon passing their hidden ability to the offspring is 60%, 3/5. Citation
Finally, IVs. This is assuming both parent Pokemon have 5 perfect IVs and one is holding a destiny knot. The probability of the destiny knot picking the 5 already perfect IVs is 1/6 and the final IV being perfect by chance is 1/32.

I've raised it from level 1 to level 71, and it hasn't even tried to evolve. The girl at the Pokemon Fan Club says ""It's amazingly friendly toward you! It must be so happy spending every day with you!"" which I learned indicated that it has 250-255 happiness, so it should be evolving. I've researched, no one has a similar problem. Also,  I am not the OT of Swadloon... Does that matter?
Am I doing something wrong? Or  did I get a 'dud' that just decided to be stubborn and not evolve?
Edit:
I think I'm just gonna have to let him be Swadloon forever. Actually I'm gonna try to evolve him on a different game (even though his happiness will reset. Oh well) 
It has got to be some kind of game bug. I don't know.
:(
Edit2:
My Swadloon evolved after being sent to my physical copy of X. The issue was on the digital copy. (Yep I've got two copies haha)

Him: You know what would cheer you up? A magikarp-et ride!

Him: You little ho-ho.
Me: You little feebas

Him: Stop acting so krabby and explain that last pun
Me: Diglett=D*cklet, Dratini=teeny

Me: I'm so good they call me the exeggutor.
Him: Yeah right. Not a chansey in heck.
Me: The only reason you can't see it happiny-ing is because you are daft.

5586	"Have I got a metronome-related tale for you all!"	"24"	"9"	"20140331"	"TogeyoshTogeyosh"	"I'm very new to this place, so I hope I fit in here. Now for my first post...!
Have you ever had a really... CRAZY experience with metronome before? When I was playing Pokemon Platinum, I was raising a togetic named Kiboh.I was EV training him during the story even (he has a calm nature)! Anyways, that's not important. So we're scaling Sinnoh's pokemon graveyard... I think it was called the Lost Tower? I ran into a youngster and he challenged me to a battle. At one point, he sent out a barboach. Since it has the EV I want, I send out Kiboh.
The only way Kiboh can attack is with Metronome. So we struggle with that... And he uses ingrain of all things! So here we go... I imagine that when this happened, poor Kiboh suddenly flew in an arc and crashed those spikes on the top of his head into the ground! So now he's stuck and upside-down! Pretty silly and cute as long as you don't remember that the nutrients he's sucking up are at least partially fueled by the decaying bodies of deceased pokemon...
But even then, born from the Earth, return to the Earth, am I right? Anyways, I'm getting off track here...
So Kiboh's moves consist of Metronome, flash, yawn, and... I think he had wish? Or maybe charm? I can't remember, but I'm going to say charm for now. So while Kiboh's just stuck there, he can blind barboach and try to get another good random attack in. He's successful at the former. But the latter, not so much. We didn't get lucky with metronome and the Tower had a permanent fog effect going for it, wrecking accuracy, so he couldn't faint the barboach before Metronome ran out of PP. I figure it's time to withdraw and split the EXP...
Except I can't withdraw. I suddenly realize to our combined horror and amusement that thanks to ingrain, KIBOH COULDN'T RETURN TO HIS POKEBALL! =O
So here we are! We end up in a stalemate for a while! Kiboh's Flash combined with the tower's fog makes it almost impossible for barboach to land a hit, and even when he does (with water gun) ingrain ensures that his efforts are in vain. But Kiboh cannot fight back either. All he can do is illuminate those red and blue triangles on his body like strobe lights (I imagine that's what happens when a toge-line pokemon uses flash~!), yawn out of boredom, or stare at the barboach as cutely as possible when it gets close enough.
So then! TL;DR: our battle has devolved into my togetic having the top of his head getting stuck into the ground, so he's forced to keep battling while upside-down! Except he and barboach can't do a thing to each other. So essentially, barboach is just flopping hopelessly around my happiness pokemon, capable of almost nothing!
Eventually, Kiboh runs out of moves and has to use struggle. So now I imagine he's finally getting fed up with the situation and recklessly flails his body every which way, occasionally smacking the fish in the process!! Thanks to our bizarre stalling tactic and ingrain, we didn't have to worry about the recoil too much and FINALLY fainted barboach, winning the battle!
But the battle took... What? 20 minutes? Because of a single metronome leading to ingrain! It's a really odd and memorable battle for us, as well as a good memory, so I figured I'd share it here.
So, thoughts anyone? It's moments like that which make the games so much fun sometimes, don't you think?

But Lacunosa Town legends say that Kyurem fell from space in a meteorite. I propose a possible theory of Kyurem's origin that reconciles the two tales.
When the legendary dragon decided to split into two to take sides in the ongoing war in Unova, it knew that doing so would cause a massive explosive burst of energy. So in order not to harm anyone, it flew into space, where in a supernova-like blast it split into Reshiram and Zekrom, who flew back to earth, leaving the empty husk of their old body floating in space. The husk froze solid from the extreme cold. As it drifted, it crashed into an icy meteorite containing a strain of the space virus that created Deoxys. The virus inhabited the husk, reanimating it and turning it into Kyurem. The meteorite continued on its course, finally crashing to earth near Lacunosa Town, where the impact created the Giant Chasm. And the rest is history.
Just a guess.

"19"	"19"	"20140609"	"turtlely_tubular"	"My friends and I are all avid filmmakers as well as Pokemon players, and we have recently been discussing a webseries idea called ""Indigo Tech"".  The setting is a school for Pokemon trainers where each teacher represents a Kanto gym leader.  The students play the game on their gameboy, but the school allows for holographic models of their pokemon and the areas to appear in particular rooms (for example, the catching room would show the Viridian Forest, Route 14, wherever you are, as well as the wild pokemon living there). Whenever you get to a gym leader in the game, you go to that teachers classroom and fight them with a link style battle, but holographs of the pokemon battling would appear in between.  The characters of the story would obviously be Red and Blue, rival students who are both hoping to be the new school champion.  Other characters in the show would be Yellow and Green, the good friends of Red.  Trainers that Red would fight along the way would be members of the production team using their personal Kanto Dreamteam.  Obviously its still a half baked idea, but I was hoping the creative minds of r/pokemon could give ideas!

Now, I'm not saying we get FR/LG remakes, but rather another Gen 1 remake. Maybe they get rid of Sevii Islands and get us something new, or not, idk. But mark my words:
[tl;dr]In 2016, we are getting Gen 1 remakes.

Another Edit: I removed rule 2
Edit: wrong use of word. Sorry about that.
The Scavenger Challenge

You cannot buy anything*
No TMs (HMs are allowed if necessary)
You can only use items that you find.

Exceptions:

If you make it to the elite 4, you can only buy 5 things per run-through.
The challenge officially finishes once you finish the main game, however, you can choose to continue during the post-game. 

Asterisks:

you are still allowed to use Pokemon centers

You can also add your own ideas. TRY NUZLOCKING IT! :D

5734	"Any ideas?"	"1"	"9"	"20140616"	"BlakeuganBlake 3368-2099-1248"	"So I just restarted my soulsilver game. I am not talking comp here, but what shouldI strive for? Right now, I have a pidgy, totodile, and a mareep. I am putting myself on this new rule set that I made up called plan ahead. Right now, all it is about is that once you catch a Pokemon,it must stay in your party till it is level 100. I'm not sure about how the rest of the rules will go, but if you have any ideas to make the rules better, it would help if you could make a google docs spreadsheet of it and add my email blakeugan@gmail.com or put it in the comments. Thanks. Also, what other pokes should I put on my team?                              
These are the rules so far:
1.) Once you catch a pokemon, it must stay on your team until it is level 100.
2.) Once you go on a route, unless you die, you must keep going until you reach the next town(meaning you can't go back to the previous town to buy potions and heal until you reach the next town).
3.) Once you put an item on a Pokemon, you can't take it off. EVER.
Exclusions:
Shinies can be switched onto your team, but not off it until it is level 100.
(soul silver and heart gold only) you may switch two Pokemon In between regions one time only. Post game(after you beat red) Rules do not apply

In Join Avenue, if you didn't know, as you rank up you'll unlock more and more ways to lower all your EV's, increase your EV's, instantly hatch Pokemon eggs, etc.

Setting:  Imagine an underground labyrinth.  Eerie fog, dark ancient stone features, ornately carved archaic symbols etched into the walls.  The darkness is occasionally broken by dimly lit candle sconces. Through the maze like cavern you discover various Ghost/dark type trainers garbed in white robes with obscured faces.  Nobody speaks.  Trainers use such pokes as Misdreavus/haunter/Drifloon/murkrow/sableye.  
After wandering through the tunnels of twists and turns, you exit into an enormous chasm.  Candles light the walls, however they do not reach to the ceiling, leaving the space overhead pitchblack.  Steps carved into the rock lead down to the cavern floor below.  Here is where the leader battle will take place.
Pokes:  again, being a doubles battle, my pokes will appear in pairs.  The battle will be held in 3 segments, each with 2 pokes from each side (total 6 pokemon from each side of course).   I will not put out a new poke until both from the pair are KO¡¦d.
First pair:
Golurk  
-Earthquake
-Hammer Arm
-Shadow Punch
-Stone Edge
Spiritomb 
-Shadow Ball
-Dark Pulse
-Psychic
-Hyper Beam
I launch Spiritomb¡¦s Pokeball above Golurk so his anchor (the rock thingy he comes out of) rests on Golurks shoulder.  He will be anchored there for the remainder of the battle.  Soon after, the goliath Golurk begins using his powerful physical moves to smash, bash, and pulverize with no pause.  During this physical onslaught, Spiritomb will be using various special based attacks to assault foes at range.  What Golurk cannot reach via smashing, Spiritomb will bombard with shadowball/hyper beam.  Psychic allows Spiritomb to grapple foes for Golurk to rip into.
Second Pair:
x 2  Froslass (yes 2 of them with the same moveset)
-Double Team
-Blizzard
-Shadow Ball
-Taunt
When both are released from their pokeballs, they immediately use Double Team to create several copies of themselves.  When using 2 of the same pokes with the same moveset, this makes it impossible to differentiate between the two.  After double team, both use Blizzard to reduce visibility/cause steady damage.  With visibility low, and a large number of targets (spawned by double team), opponents will not be able to correctly target either Froslass.  In the confusion, both will start attacking from range with Shadow Ball.  Taunt is use to again disorient and lure opposition.
Final Pair:
Bronzong  
-Hypnosis
-Confuse Ray
-Psychic
-Light Screen
Gengar  
-Dream Eater
-Shadow Claw
-Sucker Punch
-Explosion
Bronzong sits in the center of the arena, and uses Light Screen to protect from ranged/special attacks.  When opponents get close to attack, Bronzong will attempt to put the attacker to sleep with Hypnosis, or confuse with Confuse Ray.  Psychic is really only for use on ranged foes, or if Gengar falls.  Gengar fades into the abundance of shadows present in the arena.  From the shadows, he strikes with Sucker Punch/Shadow Claw.  Also, he takes advantage of foes that Bronzong has put to sleep using Dream Eater.  Explosion is a last resort for those near death moments.  The widespread damage won¡¦t much affect Steel type Bronzong, especially through the protection of light screen.

Which games do you recommend? I'm a Gen 2 fanboy so I'll definitely snag HG/SS, but I haven't played anything since Ruby. Throwing myself right into X/Y might be a little much, but will a lot of people still be playing Black & White 2 online?

but there are so many issues with mechanics that would potentially ruin the game if not done right. Character creation, Trainer Battles, Gym/League, and above all catching pokemon.
here are some of my ideas:
-Allow you to start in any city (or maybe a select number of cities) with any common pokemon in that area. There could also be role/classes that you pick when you start (Bug Catcher: +1 Catch Rate for Bug Type).
-There would still be local NPC trainers that you could only battle once (like quests). Real Trainers would have an average level based on their current pokemon, and you could accept or reject battles
-Gym Battles would also scale to your average level (down to a minimum team level of 10-20 or something). Same with the Elite Four (there would be no Champion). Beating the Elite Four of your region allows you to explore other regions.
-There could be weekly tournaments (daily?) between players (assuming there is a set of Beta players, they could be the highest ranking ppl at first). Maybe the winners could get some injectable PokeRus? Money doesn't seem like it would be valuable (unless there are no bike vouchers)
-Catching pokemon and appearance rates seem really hard to determine. Do you have to go into tall grass, or can you just bump into one in the open world? Also what about legendaries? Maybe they shouldn't even be catchable (but rather are like boss event battles) in order to preserve the mythos. It could drop a legendary egg after you defeat it, with some super miniscule chance.
It's all really shaky, and honestly who knows if it'll ever come to fruition, but I would love to just hear ideas on the topic.

"68"	"17"	"20140721"	"YoshiEgg25"	"A few years back, before Gary Garcia died, I was browsing around Google looking for Buckner and Garcia material outside of their Pac-Man Fever album. What I found surprised me.
I found that Buckner and Garcia had supposedly made an alternate version of the song, titled ""Pokemon Fever"". I, being a massive fan of both Pokemon and arcade gaming, went on a mission to find the song. I came up empty. It seemed to be completely gone.
I decided to go on the Buckner & Garcia website and e-mail them about it. If this song existed, I want to know for sure, and additionally, I wanted to hear it.
My original e-mail:

Hey guys, I'm a big fan of your stuff and was looking up some more of it when I ran across something saying that you did a version of Pac-Man Fever with Pokemon lyrics. Is there some way I can get this online? I run a Pokemon fansite, so between this and my being a fan of you, I'm very much interested in finding and listening to something like this.
Thanks a bunch, and have a good day.

I didn't expect a response back. But I got one, within the week.

Hi Mitchell:
Thanks for contacting us concerning the Pokemon song.
We did temporarily record a version of Pac Man Fever with Pokemon lyrics as a promotion a few years back but it was never released commercially due to licensing issues.
For that reason we are unable to provide any copies to the public.
Best Wishes,
Jerry Buckner
Buckner & Garcia

So it did exist! And the news from Jerry Buckner himself! But with no copies released commercially, it appeared to me to be dead. I essentially gave up the search there, though I did mention it a couple times since (and am now a source on it).
So why am I bringing it up now?
A couple days ago, ""Weird Al"" Yankovic did an AMA, and I saw a couple responses about his song ""Polkamon"" and how someone didn't know it existed. Someone mentioned wondering what other songs may have been lost in history, and obviously the link in my head stuck right on ""Pokemon Fever"".
I really want to hear this song. And I bet you all would too.
There was recently a post on /r/todayilearned about a song from the '80s that no one knew the artist of. Days later, /r/music found out who it was.
If they can do it, why can't we?
I'll sweeten the pot for anyone who thinks they can find it. I will give the first person to find this song three months of Reddit Gold. It's not much, but I'm hoping some of you will find it enough to take on the challenge.
I've got Pokemon Fever. Do you?

6011	"How much ""Emerald"" do you think we'll see in OR/AS?"	"20"	"49"	"20140721"	"SEAN771177"	"I ask this because HG/SS took many aspects of Crystal and added them to the game (mostly the story). I initially predicted that OR/AS would follow the Emerald story with the main difference being what level you catch each mascot (in OR you catch Groudon before the 8th gym at around level 50, then after the league you can catch Kyogre and Rayquaza at level 70, and vice versa). Now it seems each game will have individual story lines and villain teams much like the original R and S, which disappoints me because I enjoyed Emeralds story much more than Saphires when I originally played them. 
So...
Do you think both villain teams will be important in each game like Emerald?
Do you think you catch Kyogre and Groudon in both?
Do you think the Emerald Battle Frontier will return? 
What do you think OR/AS will be like?
(And yes I know it's been stated that these are remakes not sequels or collaborations, that doesn't mean they won't take inspiration)

Like the title says I need some help if someone could help me and either write a dumbed down tutorial (simple and easy to read) for IV breeding.
I am willing to do everything myself, but the one tutorial I've found is way too technical.
I just want to know which items I need to add to a pokemon for it to pass its ability and which item is needed to give to get good IVs.
The information I'm after the most is, how do I figure out which IVs are needed (or are the best combination) for specific pokemon.
Example: I've read a post from some guy about a pokemon that is the best with x/31/31/x/31/31
(I assume I'm wrong all the way (I'm sorry) and I didn't even get the numbers right, let alone the amount of numbers) but how would you determine which ones are good for different pokemon?
+ where do I check which IVs my pokemon have?
Also, if its possible, could somebody just give me a quick explanation about EV training. How does it work? For such training, do I have to use specific attacks or fight specific pokemon only?
I'm new to the ""advanced breeding and training"" scene and I hope there are some people willing to help me out :)
For your help, If I succeed, I could give you one of my IV bred pokemon :)

I instantly fell in love though (as evidenced by my nearly 500 hours on my Y cart), and started trying out the other games. I've been working my way backwards, so I played both Black and Black 2. They seemed like pretty solid games, if a bit rougher on the player than X/Y. I certainly had to do a lot more grinding.
Now I just recently started playing Diamond, and to my surprise I find this game a lot more fun and beautiful than Black was. The overworld seems to have the same mix of 3D buildings with 2D sprites, but doesn't look as jarring as Black. What really amazed me though was how clean and beautiful the battle sprites are. I had to look up images on line and flip back and forth just to make sure I wasn't imagining it. Example:

Diamond battle screen
Black battle screen

Also, I'm finding the opening much more enjoyable. It doesn't feel as punishing as the opening areas of Black and overall I'm having a lot of fun leveling up my little Piplup. Though I'll admit I miss my easy-peasy XP share from Gen 6 just a little bit, at least I don't feel like I'm grinding as much as I was in Gen 5. :)

6063	"How to Properly Use the GTS: A Friendly Guide"	"15"	"11"	"20140616"	"DontRockTheGoat"	"Hello, everyone! As I¡¦ve slowly attempted to actually complete my Pokedex, I¡¦ve found the GTS is incredibly useful  for getting Pokemon I just don¡¦t have the patience to catch/breed/train/use-obscure-item-on myself. But one thing I noticed is that there are many people who unfortunately don¡¦t know how to use the GTS. Allow me to break this down into four simple rules you should always follow. The first two are very important, and the second two are just helpful reminders. Without any more delay, let¡¦s begin.

1. Know What¡¦s In Demand

Over half of my income on the GTS comes from me putting up my own Pokemon and asking for what I need. I¡¦ve gotten a lot of really strong and rare Pokemon by knowing what people are going to look for. Before the release of Pokemon Bank, there were certain Pokemon you couldn¡¦t even obtain in game, along with many Pokemon that can only be found through breeding. Nobody really likes breeding for a single egg, so the GTS is a perfect spot to get what you need. I often deposit rare Pokemon that fall into the categories listed above, Pokemon like Totodile, Koffing, and Surskit. Pokemon that can only evolve through trading, like Pumkaboo and Machoke, are also very important. There are plenty of Pokemon that are like gold for XY¡¦s ¡§trading economy,¡¨ I should say, so breed these Pokemon in bulk and use them to complete your Pokedex.
Legendaries actually have a tier system of their own. At the very bottom of the tier chart are the legendaries found within XY. Everybody has them, so you might as well keep yours. The legendary birds and Mewtwo are at the very bottom, followed by Zygarde, and then Xerneas/Yveltal. In fact, before Bank somebody traded me their Xerneas for a Charizard. Following this tier are trios, like the Regis and the Lake Guardians. The value of Hoenn legendaries may be high now, but with the remakes coming out they may be falling soon. DPP and BW legendaries are still very rare though. 
Remember that this works both ways. Pokemon like Eevee, Charmander, and Froakie, are all very common in XY, and chances are, won¡¦t get you something you need. A little tip I go by: if you can go to a route and catch the Pokemon yourself with ease, don¡¦t trade for it.

2. Understand What Constitutes an Equal Trade

People will usually only trade on the GTS when they¡¦re benefitting from it as well. If they wanted to be generous, they¡¦d probably just go over to Wonder Trade. So understand that most users of the GTS are serious, looking for the greatest deals and exchanges. Even by having a rare Pokemon, this doesn¡¦t guarantee you can get anything you want. Try and learn what kinds of trades can benefit both parties. For example, a version-exclusive for another version-exclusive is probably the most basic of trades. A Skrelp for a Clauncher is as equal as it gets.
Pokemon can have different appealing traits. It can be shiny, a high level, a legendary, an otherwise hard-to-find one, so don¡¦t feel you need to be putting in immensely strong Pokemon into the GTS that you¡¦d rather keep. Not every Pokemon needs to be so valuable. A simple trading of a Paras for a Venonat is very common.
Now, I come to a lesson I can¡¦t stress enough: legendaries are very rare. You¡¦re limited to only one per save file, so they can¡¦t be squandered. And also realize that if you want a legendary, you¡¦ll probably have to offer a legendary of your own of about equal value. If you don¡¦t have one, I¡¦d recommend trading high-leveled Pokemon or shinies. Remember that Xerneas I said I was traded? Well, I traded that for a shiny Linoone. This is how trading works. You don¡¦t need to hold onto everything you get. You can just get it for the Dex info and then send it on its way. While I¡¦m still talking about the GTS, let me address something else: your low-leveled weaklings that you call Pokemon are not equivalent to a Groudon or a Regigigas. Stop asking for them, it¡¦s getting on my nerves when I¡¦m looking for actual trades.

3. Nobody is Obligated to Trade With You

I feel that people assume just because they deposit a Pokemon, somebody will automatically trade with them. Nope, that¡¦s not how it works. The GTS isn¡¦t a robot that swaps out Pokemon for you. Someobdy actually has to see your offer, consider it, agree to it, and then trade with you. I¡¦ve found most Pokemon I deposit are traded within an hour or two, but that¡¦s because I¡¦m offering reasonable trades. And just because you added ¡§Please¡¨ to your description doesn¡¦t make your trade any less ridiculous. ¡§Hmm, I probably shouldn¡¦t trade this Rayquaza for his Aron, but he said ¡¥please,¡¦ so I¡¦ll concede.¡¨ Yeah, that never happens.

4. Stop Asking for Event Pokemon

This isn¡¦t so much advice or ranting as it is simply fact. If you put up a Caterpie looking for a Darkrai, nobody will trade with you. Not because that¡¦s simply a stupid trade, but because they can¡¦t. The game won¡¦t let you transfer event legendaries, including Mew, Celebi, Jirachi, Deoxys, Arceus, Shaymin, Darkrai, Manaphy, Genesect, Victini, and Meloetta. I don¡¦t know why it¡¦s implemented, but you¡¦ll just have to find them through other means.

Her mother rolled with early Rocket bikers, and was said to enjoy the company of the high-rollers in the gang, being a favourite of the boss at the time.
Giovanni gave her a safe, irrelevant, and ambiguous task of finding rare and valuable pokemon in Kanto, knowing she would likely never find anything that would cause her any real harm.
When Ash challenge's Giovanni's gym, Jessie is the one to take over for him in his absence, in essence inheriting the role of gym leader from her father.
He's hard on her because he wants to see her succeed, but can't bring himself to show affection as it makes him a weak leader
I've only watched Indigo, Orange, and some episodes after that, so I'm sure there's a plethora of evidence proving me wrong, but the pokemon universe is full of inconsistencies.  I like the idea as it gives some depth to Giovanni who's actually a pretty crappy character.

6115	"[Suggestion] A way to change the IV system that would (hopefully) please everyone."	"14"	"28"	"20140519"	"Caviac"	"A lot of people dislike IVs, because it means you have to spend hours breeding for a ""perfect"" pokemon, and makes certain Pokemon better than others. They dislike the randomness of it and usually suggest that IVs are done away with, and every Pokemon gets the equivalent of 31 IVs when caught or bred.
Then there are people like me, who love IVs because they make every Pokemon unique. They make Nuzlockes so much more fun, because if you catch a Fletchling in two different nuzlockes, they'll actually be different, and have different strengths and weaknesses.
Now, a very simple solution that I haven't seen anyone suggest (although I'm sure it's been suggested somewhere before): Have IVs be temporarily set to 31 during online play, similar to how levels are temporarily set to 50 or 100. This allows any Pokemon to be used competitively, whether you caught it in the wild or bred it for hours. Perfectionists like me can still spend hours breeding for Perfect IVs to use in the post-game battle challenges. Maybe there could even be a setting when starting an online battle (Automatic stats: ON|OFF).
Would you guys be down for this, or are you against it?

6116	"Volcanion energy output (first time on Reddit)"	"24"	"13"	"20140519"	"FrocharochaBro, do you even evolve?"	"(correct me if i`m wrong )
Hi it's my first time on reddit and i really wanted to make a good enter here... Well anyway everybody knows that Volcanion is real, but according to it's pokedex:
""It expels its internal steam from the arms on its back. It has enough power to blow away a mountain.""
So yeah... Let`s pick Mt.Everest as an example. MT Everest is roughly 9km (28,700 ft) tall. We can estimate the total volume of Everest using the equation  V = 1/3piR2*H.
So in the end Everest weights around 6.5 *1012 kg. Now converting the energy output to destroy Mt Everest we would need something around 24 Gigatons of pure force to destroy the mountain.
Yeah, the Tsar Bomb dimensions according to wikipedia are these ones: 27,000 kilograms (60,000 lb), 8 metres (26 ft) 2.1  meters (6.9 ft) in diameter. Using the same technology we could except a bomb with a size around 192 meters, with a diameter of 48 meters weighting around 3998.4 tons (3,628,738 kilograms). An Antonov An-225 Mriya can only carries 247,000 kilograms...
Volcanion would need to release that insane ammount of energy in less than 1 millisecond if he wants to cause some damage...
We can see the destruction using Nukemap, and i'`ts not beautiful. Taking Rio de Janeiro as an example: http://i.imgur.com/HZBVYjY.png

6131	"Fishy megas?"	"0"	"1"	"20140804"	"VikingTheMad"	"So this is just something that came to mind while looking at a few of the mega evolutions, but has anyone else noticed that they look a lot like they could have been cut normal evolutions?
Take gyrados for example. His story was a carp turning into a dragon, and his mega looks much more like a carp then his normal form, which would fit with magikarp better. Seems like the mega may have been a older cut concept.
Charizard, well just look at them. Y is just a spiky version of the normal one, and X is the over done 'It looks cool, but is a bit much' type thing. Although for X they may have edited the colors and added more fire to look badass as opposed to just slight differences.
Venusaur and Blastoise suffer the same thing as X, could have worked as a normal evolution but looked over done.
Alakazam looks like either an alternate concept for the normal version, or maybe abra wasn't supposed to be in the line and that was the final evolution
Gengar, well just look at him. Aside from the eye he looks like he actually came from Haunter.
Kangaskhan, well it looks like the mega was just another concept. Honestly, it has more plates and the baby is out, I honestly thought it was just a evolution when I first saw it.
Pinsir could have been part of a evolution line, with him being a middle ground but honestly I think the mega was actually designed for the game and not a concept, if it was a concept I wish they kept it away.
Heracross looks like a evolution again, maybe thats why Pinsir got a mega or Pinsir is why Heracross didn't evolve. They want them to be equal so they had to design a mega for Pinsir just so they could use heracross's cut normal evolution
Aerodactyl suffers the over done concept but still looked cool, so they just cut it down and the mega is closer to the original idea
Mewtwo, well to be honest X looks like it was designed fresh, but I could see Y being the original, more smooth and flowing like Mew so it could have passed as the original.
Ampharos, well no idea. I have a feeling while designing the normal one someone turned on Dragon ball Z.
Scizor, looks like it might have worked as the original again, but is over dressed so to speak. 
Houndoom looks like it would have used the mega as a normal evolution if it wasn't decorated so much. But I could really see him fitting in with a third evolution bulking him up like the mega
Tyranitar actually looks more like pupitar to me. Kept the facial design better, and with the placement of said face it looks like the spikes on pupitar just grew out more. 
Blaziken, well like charizard without the fires it looks just as out of place as the normal evolution.
Gardevoir still looks like it would have worked, it's concept is an elegant masquerade dancer and with Kirlia looking like a ballerina dancer, and Mega Gardevoir's little stick legs she looks like a more direct evolution then the normal version.
Mawile, well you got me. It could have worked as an evolution, and since it doesn't gain any fairy like attributes for the typing it gained, I'd say its likely it was a evolution idea that got cut too but it could go either way.
Aggron... just look at the friggin thing. It looks much more like Lairon keeping the bulky quadruped look to it. 
Medicham, aside from the ghost arms it could work as a normal evolution. Not much to say about this guy.
Manetric, it just looks ridiculous. I'm going to say they either used a old very bad concept out of laziness, or half arsed it because Houndoom needed a counter part. And anyone else think it looks like a rat now?
Banette, I'll give this one the fair go. It doesn't look like it would fit as an evolution really, so I'd say it was designed fresh.
Absol is just... it got fluffy with wings. I think it is just a concept for it that got cut because it looks a bit bulkier then Absol is and with wings people would cry about it not being dark/flying
Garchomp and Lucario I'm counting together because they look like fresh designs too, too over kill to even be suggested as normal ones.
Abomasnow, it looks like a normal evolution that just gives more straight up bulk. Sorry but I can't see this is as a fresh design.
Latias and Latios 'FUUUUSIONNNNNN!'
That is all.
Sableye maybe could have had the evolution, but giving it a rupee wouldn't go over well.
Everything else from Omega/Alpha I can see as fairly newly deisgned. Maybe metagross considering both pre evolutions are floating the spaceship look would have went over better, but it wouldn't have matched his low speed and bulk.
TL;DR  Megas are just cut shitty concepts they're reusing.

I can understand that it's infuriating to lose, but it's amazing how many people rage quit, especially given that my wins aren't from strange Trick Room or para-flinch or stall tactics.  At minimum, I would think that people would want to complete the battle so that they could save the video and review it, or resign or let it the game finish instead of disconnecting literally before the last attack. 
I guess I would also be able to understand more if the other player were a complete casual player or if I sent the invite, but I think it's really bad manners when you send out the battle invitation and rage quit when you find yourself losing. I'm really put off by passerby battles now. 
Does anyone have something resembling a similar experience?

6216	"Pokemon Tempered Clay *EDIT*-Formerly a Rom hack, but instead will be made in RPG maker"	"2"	"5"	"20140630"	"MTBFP"	"So, this will be my first Pokemon hack. I have a windows Inspiron M531R-5535 laptop with all of the rom hacking tools that I need (I think) and I have a lot of ideas.
Pokemon: Tempered Clay (Possible Title) One concrete idea I have in particular is a hack in which most of the world has recovered from the weather-based aftermath in RSE, but the story and characters aren't the same and its only based on the region itself and the legendaries. You play as a character who lives in a refugee camp built out of rubble and with people barely surviving. Your father has three Pokemon left: Numel, Cacnea, and Carvanha (Can be changed), which I chose because I felt they were good Pokemon in their own respects as well as usable, but also because they reflect unspoken theme that you should be grateful for what you get, since your family and other survivors are living by the skins of their teeth. As for other people, civilization is in pieces and very far away from your refugee camp. Following this theme of survival, money is scarce and items are all the more valuable. There are shops, but you need badges to purchase items, which is exactly why the main characters are driven to collect all 8 badges. Only the most talented trainers receive supplies, whether its for themselves or their families. As for the Elite 4 and Champion, they live in luxury, so defeating them will not only give you the title of Champion, but net you enough money and materials to potentially restore the region. The Region Restoration is what I have planned as a Metagame, but it will be complicated to program. Also, for villains, I was thinking of creating Team Smogon, who uses all non-legendary OU Pokemon and non-legendary Ubers. In general, they'll just show up and make life difficult for everyone while also pursuing the Hoenn region's legendaries and other powerful Pokemon. As for the region itself, I plan on renaming it as its own region, parallel to Hoenn so to speak, and creating new maps from scratch.
So to sum it up:
-Pokemon Emerald Hack: Tempered Clay (Subject to change) -Different Starters (Numel, Carvanha, and Cacnea)
-Pokemon from Generations 1-3 only -New maps and characters (New sprites as well, preferably. Help on that would be appreciated)
-New villain team: Team Smogon (Subject to change) -Metagame (gameplay after story, btw): Region restoration, legendaries
*Another idea I had was including Jirachi as the main legendary in the story, or possibly just an important legendary within the story. Because it can grant wishes, it'd be ideal to obtain for the main characters' goal, as well as the antagonists' goal.
Other Edits
-Can possibly put in Pokemon from Gen 4 and 5, since this will be made in RPG maker. I am not sure about Gen.6 though. 
-I wan't all evolutions to be included, so there won't be any trading. I do, however, wan't there to be a Night/Day system.

I missed out on Generation III completely. Should I go back and play Ruby, Sapphire, or Emerald, just to have an appreciation for the new games? Or should I go into it completely fresh?
Will there be crossover multiplayer between OR/AS and X/Y? For example, if I'm playing Alpa Sapphire, will I be able to battle someone playing X or Y?
This last question is probably more for XY, but I imagine it will be the same for OR/AS, so I suppose I'll ask - is it possible to have wifi battles that don't have a level cap? All the battles I see have the Pokemon capped at level 50, but is it possible to battle another person without having the Pokemon level capped at 50? 

Thanks for any responses.

I mean, Prankster is great and all but it doesn't change the fact that his stats suck. Instead, however, he was given a MegaEvolution. 
Plus, there was the fact that Gen V introduced no new evolutions, unlike it's previous generations. Gen VI introduced Sylveon but that was pretty much to introduce the Fairy type. 
Do you think Sylveon was the last of the later-generation evolutions for Pokemon?

For this cheap price I feel like they are fake.
However, the ones pictured don't show any tell tale signs of being fake, and apparently PAL ones are much less likely to be fake as well.
The seller accepts returns, is in the UK and has 100% positive feedback from a few hundred so I can't imagine there will be much of a problem returning if they are fake. I know it's most likely not the pictured cartridges I'm going to get but there aren't any tell tale signs he will be selling fakes.
edit: sorry for adding this so soon after posting, but I have just seen someone elses game keeps crashing and doesn't connect to others. Whether it's a pokemon game or a previous item he sold isn't clear, but I'm taking this as a big no-no for now.

It's harder then it sounds.
If so we could host a Pokemon League like thing at the end of the month.
So pretty much it's simple.
You wonder trade any random Pokemon. What ever you get you have to breed it and play through the entire game with that Pokemon in your party.
The only Pokemon you can use are those you catch FRESHLY from the game.
No using failed IV Pokemon or Pokemon you have in game pre-caught.
You pretty much just grind on Wild Pokemon the entire time.
Here's the twist.
You can choose to battle other people also competing in the Challenge for ""Points""
Points are gained by beating other trainers. Each Pokemon in your party is worth 10 points.
When you battle, if you beat someones Pokemon, you gain 10 points. You can gain 60 points in a battle. 
But you have to make the opponents Pokemon faint. Even if you lose the battle. You still keep the points for how ever many Pokemon you made faint.
Who ever has the most points at the end of the challenge wins! 
Rules:
No Legendary's.
No Special/Event Pokemon.
No banned Pokemon. (Blaziken is fine. But it can't have Speed boost, anything else that is banned by them..is banned in the challenge.) 
You ARE allowed to switch your team up as you play as long as you keep your starter in your party AT ALL TIMES. 
You can catch what ever you want in game. 
Also, Just thought of this, No Daycare. Obvious reasons.
LET'S SEE WHO CAN BECOME A WONDER MASTER!!

Now let's begin with last Tuesday. Tuesday was my birthday and for it my girlfriend bought me a 2DS. This was great since I had my copy of Pokemon Y, but I had to console. What I did since I got Y was whenever my best friend and I were hanging out I would play my copy on his 3DS. So I was excited and played and I got my team to all level 100 by Wednesday. 
Now on Thursday I realized something. ""Tyranichomp, you now have a 2DS and you just got yourself wifi recently. This means we can finally use Pokemon Bank!"" I was thrilled as I have waited so long to bring over all my old Pokemon. They were all in my copy of Black 2 as that was my most recent game besides Y. Now I was just playing Black 2 a week before my birthday, you know just grinding and what not and left my DS in the living room. So there I am on the Thursday after my birthday looking for my DS and Black 2. They're no where in the living room...I start having a small panic attack.
I started looking all over my start. Check under every bed, underneath every cushion, in each room and each drawer, but there was no sign of it for two days. Then I had a truly awful thought. Recently I bought a copy of Resident Evil 6 (it came in a collectors pack of Capcom games) and before I could play that it went missing before I could play it. I know how that one went though. My older brother stole it and sold it for money. He wouldn't dare do that to my Pokemon game...would he?
The more I thought about it, the more I realized that, yes my brother is an awful human being with no signs of remorse or guilt in any terrible action he has done. Also, yes he likes to make my life hell and tries his hardest to make sure I have nothing. So, without a doubt yes, he sold my Black 2.
I cried. I'm a grown man and I cried. It's like I lost some of my best friends. Some of those Pokemon were with me for years. Years of training and dedication and playing and for what? For my game to be sold and probably use on pot because my brother doesn't work and just smokes weed and ride his motorcycle all day. I haven't even bothered to call him out on it because he never owns up to anything he's done anyway. I just have this empty feeling inside me because of what he has done. My friends, they're just gone now and there is not a god damn thing I can do.
TL;DR: Birthday passed on Tuesday and as a present, my brother sold my Pokemon friends
For anyone who read this whole damn thing, thank you. I just needed to rant and I figured this would be the best place.
Edit: I'd just like to thank you all so very much. All your kind words and advice and help have just been amazing and have made me feel a lot better. I just wanted to say I love you all :)

The toy line is coming to North American McDonald¡¦s stores once its current Spider-Man promotion ends, and judging by the image above, appear to be nothing more than flat Pokeballs with images of various Pokemon on them.

Not that it¡¦ll stop a frenzy of kids desperately trying to get them all, mind you.
However, it does seem that each Pokemon will come with its corresponding trading card, along with McPlay Power functionality, which means the toys will link up with McDonald¡¦s official app somehow. Traditionally, the chain¡¦s drinks cups have barcodes that can be scanned using the app to unlock mini-games, so we could see a similar feature with the Pokemon toys.

Ideally a name which hints towards its ancient origins, but isn't too over-the-top.
EDIT: a little more backstory. In my mind, the three regis were created for people hundreds of years ago with several large settlements each getting their own. They would obey whatever anyone told them to do. In one village, where Regirock lay, a spurned lover told regirock to kill the woman he loved out of spite, the golem obeyed destroyed her and her family.
Realising the power of the regis, the people locked each one away in a sealed chamber.

"2"	"11"	"20140428"	"andrewlayFC: 4656-7200-5995 || IGN: Andrew"	"So I had over 450 hours in my game, and this afternoon when I turn my 3ds, I wasn't really paying attention to the screen, but was just mashing the a button to get to Pokemon Y. Then my friend came and talked to be, so I closed my 3ds screen. When I open it, there was like a black screen for 5 seconds, and then the intro of the game started, with the camera being under the pokeball, and rotating and all that stuff. I didn't get to see Professor Sycamore, because I already turned off the game immediately in panic (holding the power button and then pressing the home button). I turned my Pokemon Y again, and it finally worked! my save file is completely safe, and how have been playing again.
Just wondering if this has ever happened to anyone or what might of cause it?

TL;DR at the bottom.
Flygon is one of my favourite Hoenn pokemon, I loved it ever since I got my hands on a Flygon pokemon card. This one, in case you were wondering
However, when I use it online it does not feel very great. The only thing I use my Flygon for is switching in to Electric type moves and using Earthquake every now and then. I also use U-turn to scout, but 100 base speed is not extremely high.
On Smogon the recommended set is a Choice Band/Choice Scarf set.. I personally don't like those. I'm using this Flygon now:
Flygon@Life Orb
252 Atk/4 SpD/252 Spe
Adamant
Dragon Claw
Earthquake
U-turn
Rock Slide (Fire Punch when.. or if we get move tutors again).
This set does the job, especially when the opponent does not resist Earthquake, but in the current metagame it feels like Flygon can't do anything without being killed by priority moves faster pokemon.
TL;DR:
So, are there any Flygon lovers out there who use a creative flygon set? I'll be working on a Flygon set anyway, but it's always great to hear other peoples opinions :)

I have been playing Pokemon intermittently since Yellow, but it wasn't until a few weeks ago that I found about how deeply and complex is to raise great pokemon and play competitively,
I have been using bulbapedia for many things but I just noticed that there are some, I don't know if I should call it errors, holes in the info, can someone let me know if I'm missing something?
Example:
I was thinking that I want a Chandelure for my team, so I go to the bulbapedia page, I search for game locations in X and find this: Evolve Lampent.
Ok, all good, so I need a Lampent, which according to bulbapedia page its game locations are: Friend Safari (Ghost)
Ok, so friend safari, but I can also evolve a Litwick which can be found on the Lost Hotel in X, Y
Is this missing from bulbapedia the ""Evolve Litwick"" should I add it? or I'm just a noob that is missing something?
Thanks!

Do you think that after a few big new features were added Pokemon will start to die off from being too cluttered and different?

6493	"Theory for Mega Altaria in ORAS"	"54"	"42"	"20140804"	"UltimaShadow"	"Usually I am not one to speculate but something struck me as odd when scrolling through Bulbapedia today.
Look at Altaria's moveset: You will notice it is capable of learning Moonblast and Dazzling Gleam, the only dragon type to be able to do so. Considering these are both fairy moves, I can't help but feel that Mega Altaria could be a possibility, with it becoming a Dragon/Fairy type. Considering how many of the Dex entries refer to it as graceful and having a soothing voice, it does lend itself to fairy typing a bit in regards to their overall theme. Lastly, Altaria's stats are some of the lowest among fully evolved dragons (it's highest being base 105 in special defense) so it could use the boost from a mega evolution.
TL;DR- Because Altaria learns fairy moves no other dragon can access as well as lacking stats and having a fitting design, a Dragon/Fairy Mega Altaria might happen in ORAS.

She had heard of Pokemon and didn't get much into it before. She was adopted into a Very Christian family, one that said Pokemon was the deviil. I showed her how to be a Pokemon master. She loved Pokemon after awhile, falling in love with pokemon like Keldeo, Squirtle and Mewtwo. Those were part of her team. 
One year and a couple months later, we move to my current location, Glendale, AZ. She wasnt happy here but only moved for me. So in a sense, I had to release her from the box. I told her to go be happy. She said in a funny type of way, ""I don't want to give up my cards, but do you want them?"" I teared up a bit and told her to give them to her kids when she has kids or adopts.
Long story short, I'm single and wanted to share my Poke story to you all. It hurts since it was yesterday but I know she will be happy, and hopefully, her kids as well :). Thank you for reading <3

I've been in love with Pokemon since 2nd grade (college now), and got into the competitive aspect at around 7th grade, started going to tournaments in 9th but then I sorta lost interest. However, I did love playing around with ROM files(I'm not trying to link my rom in this post) and I always wanted to make a really cool game. So late June I started making a small project, replacing all the Pokemon in Firered with Digimon, giving them their own stats, evolution and everything! The games been out for a while now, with quite a few players from r/digimon, though maybe you guys would be interested in it. The main reason I came to r/pokemon is because I know a lot of you guys love battling and I'm starting signups for a tournament using the game over VBA. You're digimon only need to be level 50 to compete, so it wouldn't take long to get there if you're interested. Hope you guys are!

So...should I wait for the ""new"" 3DS LL or go ahead and buy the 3DS XL and enjoy gens 5 and 6 now? What do you think would be the best option?

6636	"PSA: Pokeball art is (mostly) a sham and extremely unethical"	"5"	"4"	"20141007"	"SketchYourPost"	"Pokeball art is a really clever way to show the essence and elements of a Pokemon. The original idea was extremely well done and unique, as people would create pokeballs for the specific Pokemon they love. 
As a member of the art community, I can tell you what really happens with Pokeball art. From a regular person's standpoint, Pokeball art is amazing, innovative, colorful, and beautiful. 
However, the controversy of Pokeball art, especially among many artists in the art community, is huge. Most people will enjoy Pokeball art. People will view it, favorite it, and compliment it. There are several famous pokeball artists in the DeviantArt community. Believe me when I say that if you've seen Pokeball art here on reddit, they were made from one of these artists. What I'm about to say applies to ALL the artists, without exception, as I have dug into it and seen what was going on. 

Pokeball artists do not ask for permission. They simply give credit, but that is an extremely unethical thing. They get away with using any resource they want without giving any credit, and although they give credit, they write it in the smallest font possible, and most of the comments on the page compliment the art itself. There are several ""famous"" pokeball artists who continuously get to the front page of deviantart.com. One day, a person in the chatroom was getting pissed. He was a Pokemon artist, and a good one. He was complaining about how a Pokeball artist took his work without asking and used it in his art. Some artists just don't check if their art is being used, but this is extremely unethical and they are using other peoples' art to rack up views and favorites. 
Pokeball artists use a variation of a technique called Matte Painting. In Matte Painting, you take different images and photographs and place them strategically, paint over them, create some filters and blending, and you integrate them into a drawing. Pokeball artists take several photographs are drawings, put them together, give the credit of each artwork in small ""disclaimer-style text,"" without asking permission. People don't seem to understand that putting these things together can take under 20 minutes, if you don't ask for permission. 
Some Pokeball artists do ask for permission, but only from the more famous and well-known artists. However, I have been told by a couple of well-known artists that Pokeball artists only ask them for one or two drawings, not their entire gallery, and there are certain pieces that they did NOT give permission to and used anyways. Again, this is unethical
Ever heard of the hype train? There hundreds if not thousands of Pokeball arts, ranging from Pokemon to DBZ characters to Game of Thrones characters. Pokeball art is almost a guaranteed way to throw yourself into the front page. All you need is google, a bit of Photoshop knowledge, and twenty minutes of your time. 

There are a couple of good Pokeball arts flying around, with people drawing their own Pokeballs, Pokemon, and creating their own special effects. However, none of these are as popular anymore, simply because there are so many Pokeball arts that the genuine creators have lost interest.. 
Just a PSA about how the art community is divided in this controversial detail. Do keep in mind that the famous Pokeball artists DO have some work where they have full permission to use every piece. But many of the same artists do not have permission of lesser known artists. 
TLDR: Pokeball artists do not draw or create the details of each art piece themselves, they take the effects and features of other people's art and put them into their own. They do give credit, but they usually do not ask for permission, which is very unethical. They give credit in tiny font that most people do not see, which results in many people complimenting them and recognizing them as good artists who draw or create the entire piece from scratch.

I have translated the error message that is popping up, and it says the website is currently out of codes. I suggest trying again another day, when they will probably have more codes uploaded.
After a couple people have posted a website to get the code online, I put together a quick tutorial on how to get the code in a couple minutes.
You need Google Chrome and the Chrome extension: Hola Better Internet if you do not live in Mexico.

Open Google Chrome and install Hola Better Internet.
Go to http://10minutemail.com/10MinuteMail/index.html. Use this email address to fill out the form in the next step, and keep this tab open!
Go to http://gameplanet.com/pokemon-sg/ and click on the fire icon now in your Chrome toolbar. Where it says ""Select a country"", click on ""More"" then select Mexico.
Fill out the form on the page that says ""Para cualquier Player (sea o no cliente Gameplanet)"". It looks like this when translated. Your information doesn't need to be real, and you don't have to do the Optional parts.
After filling out the form, refresh the 10minutemail page after a minute or two, and you should have an email from the Gameplanet website, with a link to a webpage. The page will look like this.
To redeem, open Pokemon X/Y, click on ""MYSTERY GIFT"", then ""RECEIVE GIFT"", then ""YES"", then ""GET WITH CODE"", then put in the code on the page you were emailed.

If anyone is having issues with this, message me on reddit or comment here, and I might be able to give people having issues a code :)

So, meaning that team flare has been in the process for a long time, and J was just the beginning. But, their plans fell.

I will be inserting cardstock into them, the give them a bit of stability, but I did not want to leave the paper plain white, so I had an idea. Being as I draw a lot, I wanted to maybe draw a design for each set, incorporating that set's symbol and a pokemon (example, jungle symbol which is a flower and flareon or another pokemon). For Base set I think I will actually spell out Base Set in a cool font and have charizard sitting on top of it and it's tail makes the letter ""s"" in Set, what do you think? I am posting this on here to ask for ideas for every set (yes, ALL of them)
What pokemon do you think I should use with each set? As well as if I should use just the set symbol or, like I plan to do with base set, use a cool font and put the name as well. I am open to ideas and suggestions of every kind :)
Also this is probably going to take a while, but every time I finish one I will post it on here for people to see and critique. Eventually I will get through all the sets!

Charizard (F) @ Charizardite Y
Ability: Blaze
Shiny: Yes
EVs: 4 Atk / 252 SpA / 252 Spe
Hasty Nature

SolarBeam
Flamethrower
Rock Slide
Air Slash

I chose Charizard Y because Char.Z. is a higher population so I expect a lot players to know how to deal with Z better than Y despite having x4 weakness to Rock. Charizard has high SpA so naturally I want to increase that power. It's Spe was good but I wanted it to be better. Hasty for Special Fast Sweeper. I choose Solar Beam because there is a chance I'll get an opponent who is a Rock/ Water/ Ground type so having an opposing move to have the upper hand. Flamethower  for STAB attack comes natural but I'm debating on replacing it with Fire Blast. I prefer having at least one opposing move according to my type for the other Fire/Flying that might have the upper hand on half my type since Rock Slide is their. Even though Air slash is Physical despite being a Spa+ Pokemon it's for the opponents who might have a poor Def but SpD to make up for it.
Glalie (F) @ Focus Band
Ability: Inner Focus
EVs: 252 HP / 252 Spe
Serious Nature

Substitute
Earthquake
Ice Beam
Toxic

I've been berated for having a Glalie over a Froslass. Between the 2 Glalie has 4 x2 weaknesses no immunities but Froslass has 5 x2 weaknesses 2 immunities.Some of you might notice that I should probably have Moody as an ability instead but it is banned in OU battles unfortunately. Shadow Ball and Dark Pulse is popular amongst the crowd so I'm taking my chances. Focas band because a lot of people seem to have those types Fire/Fighting/Rock in their team.  EV increase on Spe and HP because Glalie stats are all equal so I'd rather him be kind of good in everything than great in one and poor in the other. He's my balanced Pokemon. Earthquake because why not? It'll destroy Fire/Rock/Steel competitors. Ice Beam for STAB. I like to Toxic then substitute to keep me going.
Gengar (F) @ Black Sludge
Ability: Levitate
Shiny: Yes
EVs: 4 HP / 252 SpD / 252 Spe
Timid Nature

Knock Off
Sludge Wave
Destiny Bond
Dazzling Gleam

Gengar is an all time favorite so no questions needed. Black Sludge is popular item compared to LeftOvers. Evs on SpD to pair up with its naturally high SpA stat and Spe+ to have the first move just about always. Knock Off because every trainer has an item so their a rare chance of it not working so well. Sludge Wave for STAB and Fairy/Psychic opponents. Destiny Bond in case my Spe isn't enough and opponent has the upper hand Knock-Off makes up for being able to attack Ghost types since I am without one. Dazzling Gleam as an opposing move for my type for other Poison/Fighting/Dragon opponents.
Hydreigon (F) @ Dragon Fang
Ability: Levitate
EVs: 4 Def / 252 SpA / 252 Spe
Timid Nature

Dragon Pulse
Dark Pulse
Focus Blast
Flamethrower

Timid nature because I sacrifice Atk for better Spe. Dragon Fang to assist with STAB on Dragon Pulse might get Draco Meteor instead. Hydreigon is also Spa and Spe based Pokemon so I built on it with EVs. His Def and SpeD is decent compared to Char.Y. since one is under the other. Dark Pulse for STAB attack. Focus Blast as an opposing move according to type for Rock/Ice/Steel/Dark/Normal opponents. Flamethower to take out the Ice types that jump in might replace it with Fire Blast.
Cradily (M) @ Big Root
Ability: Suction Cups
EVs: 4 HP / 252 Def / 252 SpD
Brave Nature

Amnesia
Toxic
Giga Drain
Rock Slide

I've always had an abnormal love for Cradily, it's just something about it that draws me in. Suction Cups are helpful for the opponents who realize my Defense based stats and try to Whirlwind/Roar me away.  Since Cradily stats express poor Spe I went ahead sacrificed it for Atk+ since I'm equipped with Rock Slide. My Big Root assists my Giga Drain. I have been tempted to replace it with leech seed in case of my Cradilys fatality and team still has the upper hand. Toxic to poison the opponent and Amnesia to boost SpeD to hold me out. I am tempted to replace Amnesia with StockPile.
Luxray (M) @ Rocky Helmet
Ability: Rivalry
Shiny: Yes
EVs: 4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Spe

Crunch
Thunder Wave
Volt Switch
Iron Tail

Is my trusty dusty Electric type who I've been told Rocky Helmet is a great attribute for it since it's my Physical Sweeper. Crunch is a popular Dark Physical Attack which is great for lowering Defense for my high attack Stats. Thunder Wave to stall the opponent. I have Volt Switch  for when times my opponent decides to trade pokemon who have an advantage but tempted to drop it for Thunder/Thunderbolt or a physical Electric like Thunder Fang. Iron Tail for Rock types who know Ground Moves and Fairy/Ice/Rocks.
TL;DR Bad team is bad. :(
EDIT: Some of you are wondering why I'm not on Smogon RMT and I would like to point out golden words from user /u/CyberDork35 as to why I'm not there.

Yeah, the people on Smogon forums do that a lot. If your team is atrociously bad, they bash you without helping to improve your team. If your team is really good (I'm talking 1900+ on the OU ladder or something) they praise you and offer help. But if your team could ACTUALLY USE TWEAKING, they ignore you >:(

When you look at pokemon up on Bulbapedia for example, you'll see its BASE stats. That is the stats it'll have at lvl 100 with all IV's and all EV's at 0. This is what I mean by ""Base Stats""
Now the nature specifies that it boosts 1 stat by 10% and reduces another by 10%.
Does that mean its boost and reduces the ""Base"" of the those stats, OR does it also affect the IV and EV's?
And example to make it absolutely clear. Lets say take Bulbasaur.
At level 100, its base Special Attack is 65, and its base Attack is 49. On top of this, this Bulbasaur has 31 IV points in bother stats, and 120 EV points (120/4=30). So our Bulbasaur has 65+31+30=126 Special Attack, and 49+31+30=110 Attack at level 100%
Now for the question. Will the nature affect the whole pool stat, or some combination of it? For example if our Bulbasaur is Adamant (+10% Sp Attack, -10% Attack), which of the following is correct?
Special Attack = 1260,9 = 113,4
Attack = 1101,1 = 121
Or
Special Attack = (650,9)+31+30 = 119,5
Attack = (490,9)+31+30 = 114,9
Naturally if it effects something different, like say Base and IV, feel free to correct me.

- Roxanne and Brawly's Pokemon have pretty much the same moves as before, and Rock Tomb & Bulk Up are still TMs, so it seems they'd stay the same.
- Wattson's Pokemon now know Volt Switch instead of Shock Wave, so he probably gives you Volt Switch now, which makes sense as Shock Wave isn't a TM anymore.
- Flannery's Pokemon and their moves have changed a little, but two of them still carry Overheat, so there's a good chance she still gives Overheat.
- Norman's Pokemon no longer run Facade, favoring Retaliate on all three instead, suggesting that he now gives Retaliate instead of Facade.
- Winona still has Aerial Ace on 3 of her Pokemon, so she probably still gives that TM.
- Tate & Liza's Pokemon have pretty much the same moves as before, so Calm Mind is still a safe bet for them.
- Wallace's team is where it gets interesting. He used to give Water Pulse, but with it not being a TM anymore, it's tricky to guess what he'll give now. The only Water-type TMs in Gen VI are Scald and Rain Dance, but none of his Pokemon know Scald and only 1 carries Rain Dance. However, 3 of them now know Waterfall. So there's a chance maybe instead of giving you a TM, Wallace now gives you the HM for Waterfall.
Anyone have any thoughts on this??

I remembered playing Gold and Crystal when I was little and wow, shit got really deep and complicated for Pokemon if you wanna jump into it :D
I've gotten my 8 badges, beaten Elite 4 and the champion, and captured some legendaries(no Red encounter this game? sad) and currently looking into filling my pokedex and playing in the battle mansion. Are there any other end game activities that are fun?
I've browsed the guide megathread and all the new features and stats are very overwhelming, so i'm asking for some ELI5 explanations for them:

What's EV, IV, Nature and how big an impact do they have?
What's important when doing lv50 cap battles? does lvl matters or is it enough just to lvl them to only 50?
how does super training works? am i stuck with the stats when i was just trying to unlock higher lvl trainings?
how to check my friend code and what is friend safari?
can i trade with a DS system with my 3DS if i buy white/black 2 for my 3ds? (system to system, like DS to DS with infrared, but with DS to 3DS)
there are so much more pokemon now than there was, which ones to choose? Are some pokemons far superior than others or is it just depends on how you breed and train them so you can use whatever you like?
follow up to my last question, how strong is mega evo? are the ones without it 'bad' compared to those that do?

Thanks in advance!

What I mean is I have been playing it for about an hour but all I seem to ever do in battles is the same thing again and again and again. So in each battle at first I lower their defence then just attack and attack and attack and always win. I am assuming the battles get more complicated when I have to start being more strategic with different types, etc. yes? 
This is the first time I have ever played a Pokemon game and I don't really have any experience with turn based RPGs. I am a Zelda and Mario gamer. That being said I like the idea of collecting all the Pokemon and exploring I just feel I am missing something about these games that makes it click for all of you.

"After some work I've finally been able to unlock the hidden mission, and for others attempting to do the same here are a few things I've noticed: first, it didn't appear as unlocked option at first, instead I had to accept a mission and see the following dialogue; ""It looks as though running them off once wasn't enough. That foolish team is back and causing more trouble. Orlando, I'll ask for your assistance once more."" I won't describe the mission itself since I think that's already been covered, so I'll just move on. Second, soft-resetting doesn't necessarily seem to do much as when I accepted missions previously the dialogue was usually the same but sometimes had a second option, suggesting that after each save you might be restricted in your options regardless of soft-resetting. Although after some time the options might change by themselves, but I'm not sure about this. Instead I would focus on doing the easier missions where you have to find people or Pokemon when possible, or battling the expert, depending on when I had options, because they seem to be the fastest. Third, I think that talking to NPCs might be linked to unlocking it, assuming it isn't totally random, as I talked to a new NPC in the town before completing a mission and was able to do the secret mission right after that. It could be a coincidence, but speaking to all possible NPCs might be a requirement or in some way affect your chances of unlocking it.
That's basically all I've got and others might be able to disprove it, but it seems like it's best to quickly breeze through missions if you want to unlock the secret mission because you may need to accept a mission before seeing that the secret mission has been made available and soft-resetting the same save may or may not help make it available. Aside from that, May has a Raichu and a Swellow in the demo but does not seem she has any other Pokemon coded in as I knocked those two out and she didn't use any others. Finally, after completing the mission it becomes available again afterwards under the 'Let's go somewhere secret!' option and you can battle the other team, although this may be random.

I was never told once that I needed a pre-order for ORAS. Only one place asked me AFTER they gave me the code cards if I was all pre-ordered and ready for the games. I already have my pre-orders in so I said ""Yep, I am all good"" Everyone was really nice at all 4 stores and one store even asked me how many I wanted (just 2 for me, no  need to be greedy). Only one store just handed out one code per person to make sure there were plenty for others. So out of 4 stores, I managed to snag 7 code cards. 2 of which are for my X and Y, one for a friend who lost her 3ds and I am hoping she finds it before the event ends, and 4 extras for people here on reddit. I am not giving away the 4 code cards yet but I will soon enough.

Pick a Pokemon type
Create a monotype team of this type
Profit !

The thing is, it has to be constituted of your favorite Pokemon of the chosen type. Of course dual type Pokemon count for the two types they are. Don't worry about Smogon tiers, or even the value of your team in terms of weaknesses and so forth, or even the availability of your Pokemon in a single game. Just choose your favorite. 
If you have too many Pokemon to choose from, you can for example try to make a rematch team to inculde them all. If you don't have enough, pick another type or post your team anyway ! Gym leaders don't always have a full party after all !
To make it more challenging, you can try to pick your least favorite type and see that, maybe, it is not that bad after all. I myself started a Poison monotype challenge on Pokemon X recently, and I thought I wouldn't be able to create a full party, but I was really surprised to see that this type actually has solid designs.
Here was my team :

Vileplume
Nidoqueen
Dragalge
Croagunk
Crobat
Scolipede

And for the rematch team, I would probably switch Crobat for good ol' Gengar. (And switch Croagunk for Drapion, if I cared for a certain balance in weaknesses. But I don't like Drapion all that much.)
There ! Thank you for having gone through all these explainations, and I hope you have fun doing this, and maybe try a monotype challenge on your own to try Pokemon you overlooked !

Download Pokemon Bank
Go into the app, and set up your bank
You'll be given a choice to receive 100 pokemiles or 10 BP from Brigette. Choice either, and after this choice, save, quit, and go back onto Pokemon X/Y
On the opening screen of Pokemon X/Y, open ""Pokemon Link"" (green button at the bottom)
Select ""Yes"" to ""retrieve data using Pokemon Link""
You should receive your 100 pokemiles/10 BP
Now, go back into the pokemon bank app and repeat steps 3-6. Brigette will give you a celebi instead of the 100 pokemiles/10 BP

Now, I have yet to download via Pokemon Link after Bridgette gave me the Celebi, because I have a question first. Is there a way to SR for nature? I was told mixed things on this subreddit when I asked at the last PSA. I was told by some people that it just appears in your PC, and I was told by others that it is given by a person at any Pokemon Centre, just like the Pinsir/Heracross events. Now, I am wondering which is true, and if the first, is there ANY way to SR for nature/IVs? I was REALLY hoping to use one competitively, and being able to use this one would help immensely

To fix this I have moved closer to my router and the result is I seem to be able to connect to the internet more consistently (every time I hit connect to internet) as where in the past I usually connect 1 in 10 times.
Now my problem is that I have played 5 games tonight and each one has ended in a disconnect but I am unsure as to which side it has been on as I feel it is likely that I disconnected due to my internet connection history. On the other hand every time the disconnect has happened it has been just as I was about to close out the game for a victory.
Mainly I would like to know:

Are disconnects a loss on the record even if it is my opponent who disconnects, as all the games have resulted in a loss.
Is there anything else I can do to stay connected to the wifi on my 3ds.

Right now I'm sending out a lot of the Starters and ones that you can't get outside of Friend Safari; right now I'm sending out Totodiles and Cyndiquils, for a while I was sending out Grimers (some w/its hidden ability) but I am somewhat limited by what i can send out because I have to get it first before I can breed it. I also have Porygon and some other pretty rare ones to share.
In case anyone is intrigued, I'm typically on Wondertrade between 1230-3am CST (late I know but I work a late shift).
TL;DR: What Pokemon (besides legendaries and shinies) would make your day if you saw it come through on Wondertrade? Any starters, or Pokemon you can't easily get in Gen 6? I'll start breeding up any ones I have, infect them, and shoot them out there for people then.

With Primal Reversions coming about and sending the pokemon back to there ancient fourms, do you think this plot hole that GF opened will be expanded on?

Kyurem-Complete, the Boundary Pokemon
Type: Dragon/??? (Nothing when Ideal is suppressed)
Ability: Ideal
Flavor text; this Pokemon¡¦s stats and type become Ideal against Pokemon that do not challenge its might. 
Upon entering Battle: Ideals are pursued or The Truth suppresses the Ideal.
In-depth: Against Pokemon who have a less Base-Stat-Total, this Pokemon¡¦s attack and defense stat¡¦s along with type change in calculation in order to provide the most or least damage. 
Examples: 
¡E Pokemon with Ideal delivering physical damage; this Pokemon¡¦s highest stat becomes ATK and its type is switched to a type that will deliver STAB (No double stab)
¡E Pokemon with Ideal receiving physical damage; This Pokemon¡¦s highest stat becomes DEF and the type becomes a type that is resistant to the attack type.
¡E Pokemon with Psystrike/Psyschock attacking a Pokemon with Ideal: Ideal would make the Pokemon¡¦s secondary type dark, causing it to be immune, but under unusual circumstances the Pokemon¡¦s DEF becomes the highest stat.
¡E Pokemon with Foul Play attacking a Pokemon with Ideal: Ideal would make that Pokemon¡¦s secondary type Dark and the Pokemon¡¦s highest stat will be DEF and lowest Stat will become ATK.

Veracity
Type-???, Cat-Status 100 Pwr, 100% Acc, 10 PP
Flavor Text: All deceptions are extinguished and battle is then executed. The Truth prevails.
Move can be used on the target regardless of its Abilities, also ignores the opposing Pokemon's stat changes. This move will switch between physical- and special-type damage, whatever will provide the most damage. This move will switch between Fire, Electric, and Ice-typing whatever will provide the most damage. This move has a 30% Chance of Freezing, Burning, or Paralyzing. When used on a Pokemon, it will force a Primal Reversion (or Mega Evolution?) if possible and will do no damage that turn.
Absolute Zero
Type-Ice, Cat-Special, 20 Pwr, 100% Acc 5PP
Flavor Text: Absolute Zero is reached. Freezing the target and drastically lowering their speed. Fails if Ideal is suppressed. (Since Absolute Zero is an Ideal itself)
TL;DR does Primal Reversions and Kyurem having a cannon another fourm. possible mean that we will get our(my) biggest let down of Generation 5  answered?

6943	"RNG team battle! (I'm so fucked)"	"0"	"4"	"20140922"	"tinyj316"	"So, I decided it would be fun to pick 6 teams of 6 pokemon at random using random.org and then challenging my buddy. so I did that, and these are the teams courtesy of RNGeezus
Team 1: Shuckle, Pichu, Houndoom, Miltank, Duskull, Cranidos
Team 2: Monferno, Chinchou, Klefki, Barbaracle, Barboach, Sandslash
Team 3: Typhlosion, Sentret, Surskit, Kingler, Quilladin, Ludicolo
Team 4: Levarny, Volcarona, Glalie, Goodra, Farfetch'd, Marril
Team 5: Shieldon, Mienfoo, Poliwrath, Amaura, Finneon, Clefable
Team 6: Beartic, Omanyte, Lapras, Umberon, Makuhita, Eelektrik
Keeping with the pure randomness of the challenge, we RNG'd the teams we would be playing. My friend is going to be on Team 4, while I'm on Team 1 (I'm so fucked).
The rules of the team are just like you'd find in competetive, but the big thing is that you can't evolve your dudes. Since I have Pichu on my team, I have to actually battle with Pichu, I can't use Pikachu or Riachu. He can't use Azumarill, just Marill...etc... 
So, on a scale of 1 - 10 how fucked am I? Can I make this team work at all?!?

The beast trio have overworld sprites and a remix of their theme unused in R/S' files.
The Beast trio hasn't been featured in any games lately
They HAVE hidden abilities, but they are unreleased
Their shinies look good, and are VERY hard to get
Fans generally view them positively
Who else thinks this almost confirms they'll be in ORAS?  (hopefully with megas...)  It'd work too well, and those abilities would give them a huge buff.  Comment reasons you think they will/won't be in ORAS!

Tyranitar(Sandstream), Lucario(Justified), Swampert(Torrent), Empoleon(Torrent), Tyrantrum(Strong Jaw), and Torterra(Overgrow)
Hippowdon(Sandstream), Excadril(Sand Rush), Blaziken(Speed Boost), Furfrou(Fur Coat), Electivir(Motor Drive), and Crustle(Sturdy)
Abomasnow(Snow Warning), Tentacruel(Liquid Ooze), Landorus(Intimidate), Lapras(Shell Armor), Glaceon(Ice Body), and Mamoswin(Thick Fat)
Now I know it's important to not focus on a specific type, but I find myself doing that with two of these three teams. What team do you guys think would do the best from these 15 Pokemon? Or should I just build a new team entirely? Move sets aren't exactly final but blaziken was a sweeper set up with speed boost and baton pass along with swords dance.

I was very into pokemon during Generations 1 and 2 but haven't really played since then. I recently pre-ordered X/Y and I picked up HeartGold today to get back into the series.
My questions have to do with pokemon transfers. I don't know anything about how to transfer (or trade?) pokemon over different generations. I will have fun with HeartGold either way, but it would be great knowing that I'm helping my future progress in X/Y by collecting various pokemon now.
So my questions are:
Will we be able to trade or transfer Pokemon from HeartGold to X/Y.
If so, how does that work? Will I need multiple 3DSs? Will 3DS to 3DS work or could I do DS to 3DS? Any other tips for someone who has just started thinking about collecting pokemon across generations? 
My ultimate goal obviously is to get every pokemon in my pokedex for X/Y so any advice or websites that has to do with that would be very helpful. (I realize that I'd probably have to get other games to accomplish this, but I'll start with HeartGold for now).
Thanks!

Anyway I started resetting this morning for a timid gengar.  I've gotten 5 of them so far but when I checked the stat man in kiloude they all have had rather poor stats or stats in the wrong area.  I just got one that is timid and has above average stats.  The man says its greatest potential lies on its speed stat.  This pokemon has some fantastic stats.  
Do you guys think I should call it good?  I don't think I'll get much better than that.

Once upon a time (probably about 11 years or so ago), I ended up buying both Ruby and Sapphire at Wal-Mart for my old GBA.  That was back in the days when I would just say, ""Fuck it, I'm buying both versions.""  I never played all the way through them, and lost interest about partway.
After not playing much of Diamond, Pearl, or SoulSilver, and missing HeartGold, Platinum, Black, White, Black2, White2 entirely, they pulled me back in with Y.  I got Y because a few of my friends had X, and I figured we could help each other with filling out the others' PokeDexes.  I don't know if my friends have made decisions yet on which one they'll get.
So, Redditors, I pose the question to you: what will be the differences between Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire?  Obviously both versions will have certain Pokemon exclusive to each.  Any other differences?  Does one legendary have a big advantage over the other?  
TIA for any help you can provide.

I had the pleasure of visiting your site today to price the upcoming Pokemon titles.  I was more than a little surprised to see them retailing for E59.99. Can you please provide some form of explanation or justification for such ridiculous pricing? I am a student, do you honestly think I have the money to pay for this? I have priced numerous other vendors online, and with conversion to euro, the most expensive price I am seeing is E45. How do you think it is acceptable to charge what you are charging for a children's handheld console game? Xbox games are going cheaper. I am not normally one to send these type of emails but I do think the entire situation is a disgrace. 
And while you do seem to be a monopoly in the market, it is this kind of pricing that will finish you.

All normal Nuzlocke rules apply. Note: an emulator must be used for this challenge, and randomizers make it more fun.

You can only catch the first encounter if it is a PURE Normal (No Normal-Flying), Poison, Dark, Fighting, Psychic, Bug or Ground type for you to be able to catch it. For older generations, any Normal Pokemon retyped to Fairy is ineligible (this includes the Blissey and Jigglypuff families. Even though they are Normal types, they are too cute for Team Rocket). Even if a future evolution is of that type but the encounter is not, you may not catch it, an example being Mudkip (Water) to Swampert (Water Ground). Note: Your starter does not need to follow these rules.
If the first encounter on that route is an ineligible type, you may steal from a trainer on that route (emulators). However, it must be that trainers last Pokemon, and it's health has to be in the yellow to steal it. The stolen Pokemon can be any type. Also, it does not have to be the first trainer you battle, you have your choice to defeat one trainer and steal from the next. For areas with no wild encounters (cities), you may go straight to stealing from trainers (gym leaders). Do not steal from your Rival(s).
Try to avoid battling other Team Rocket members if possible in games where present, but dominate the opposing team in games with other antagonists.
Be a dick to everyone when possible. If someone asks ""Hey, do you love Pokemon?"", say ""No"", or other dick dialogues accordingly.
You win the challenge by capturing all the Legendary Pokemon possible in the respective region, for the glory of Team Rocket!

Some study-friends and I started a pokemon challenge. We all have 2 weeks to play fire red and build a team. After the two weeks we fight against each other. The rules are simple: No cheats,no trades. 
I've played pokemon when I was a kid but never played it or trained my pokemons to win a link battle so I am a noob. Of course I've read a whole bunch of ""Team Building FAQ's"" at gamefaqs.com and looked thru some threads at smogon.com but there are so much informations that I can't bring them down to one good team. So I need your help reddit. I don't want links to more guides I want one example of one team which I can get with the given rules. (I would prefer a tss team because I watched some battles on youtube and they looked quite strong in firered)
Thanks in advance!
tl;dr Please suggest me a full team which you can get on FireRed without trading/cheating which is good enough to beat some other people who don't really know much about pokemon aswell.

The last time I played Pokemon, it was Red and Gold on NO$GBA - I had them for the GBC but much preferred playing on a PC (easy save/load, ability to run it at a higher speed to zoom through tedious conversation).
I assume the modern answer is ""buy a 3DS, then buy $games"" - is that true? If not, what? If so, what games? I understand Red/Blue and Gold/Silver were remade, but if I'm planning to get e.g. Platinum etc., is it worth me bothering with FireRed/LeafGreen?
Advice / opinions much appreciated! I'm in the UK if that makes any difference...
Edit: Thanks for the replies! Just to clarify, I'm looking to catch up with the current state of the games, but I'm confused about what to buy now - do I buy Black/White if Black2/White2 are coming out? What replaces what? What do I buy right now to have ""all of the games""? Thanks!

"0"	"7"	"20141027"	"Eagleby18Best Pokemon Hands-Down"	"In case you missed the memo, the hackers found that the Elite Four in ORAS can be rematched at some point in the aftergame.  In the rematches, their levels go as high as the 70s, and they ALL have mega evolutions.  Dark guy uses Mega Absol, Ghost chick uses Mega Sabelye, Ice lady uses Mega Glalie, and Dragon Pirate uses Mega Salamence.  Steven of course uses Mega Metagross in both the first and second battle.  If you want the rest of their teams, both before and after they aquire mega stones, this guy made a video on it.
But remember that the hackers also found their character sprites, and none of them have any visible mega keystones.  If they had alternate sprites with keystones programmed to appear later on, the hackers would have found those too.  Does this open the doors for more trainers to use Mega evolution in this and future Pokemon games?  Could the secret base guy's Flygon be a mega after all (in the current code, it's holding a normal gem, which is completley useless)?  Gym leader rematches with megas one day?  Gym leaders using megas in their first fight one day?  Is there a future where normal everyday NPC trainers use mega evolution?  What do you guys think?
Personally, I think this gives gamefreak no excuse to give Wallace a mega Milotic.  In the aftergame, there's this battle against the team he uses as champion in Emerald version, but with Milotic's Sitrus Berry missing.  It would be an absolute disgrace if ALL the E4 of a region got megas, and one of it's champions didn't.

i'v been challenged MANY MANY  times against people who had ENTIRE parties of legendaries, i beat em all with regular pokemon, sometimes i'v even beaten entire legendary teams with a megadactyl with hone claws or a dragon danced rock head Tyrantrum with head smash, i'v even beaten Mewtwo with Malamar! As high based stats as some legendaries are, they aren't invincible, its not the legendary status that changes everything, its the trainer
As for the battle towers... well i'm not talkin about using legendaries in regular singles, that just overkill, clearly they have a good reason to be banned there, i'm talkin about in super singles, not everyone is gonna wanna use the truant durant and speed boost blaziken trick, but i'm sure i'm not the only one to realize the super singles are a brutal and terrible battleground, i can bet you even if you were permitted with your legendary pokemon, you'd probably still find a match up that would ruin that sweet streak you had, but hey, at least its more fun to have awesome legendaries in the towers, i bet some legendaries could give an edge, not the game breaking kind mind you, but sometimes the little things help
what do you think? should you be allowed to use the legendary you worked through most of the game to get? or should it stay banned because you think cause its legendary its godly stats will mow down nations of pokemon parties.

I can think of two reasons, both of which I'm not sure.

I setup my profile on the day of my birthday. Maybe it doesn't immediately get recognized, so maybe I'll be greeted next year.
I setup my profile after I started the game so maybe it thinks my birthday is 1/1 or something

So I'm just wondering if any of you guys know for sure. I tried Googling about it, but apparently people are too cool to care about being greeted in some fictonal world by a fictional nurse so it seems nobody has brought this up.

I have a 6 maxed IV Rotom, Ralts, and Fletchling but also have 5 IV ones that are not maxed in their undesirable attack stat. Which of these would actually be better for competitive play?

Hello Everyone,
Everyone¡¦s (not) favorite annoying psychic here. Before you try and catch me, I want to announce my second pokemon marathon with my friends, called ¡¥A WILD MARATHON APPEARED.¡¦ We will be doing our second pokemon marathon June 21st-23rd! AWMA is the group name I¡¦m going to refer to Joe, Crystal, Katie, Emily and whoever else wants to help us stream.      
We are again donating to Free the Children, an international non profit that benefits children in developing countries by building schools, wells, and supplying teachers and food to children. Last time we raised over $1,000. Our First Goal is $649, but that doesn't mean we will stop there once we get it. 

We will be running FireRed, SoulSilver, Emerald, Platinum, White and Black2. When we aren't playing those we will also be playing Pokemon Snap, some Smash Bros, and some other extras! We will be playing those mostly during the lulls between games and during The Gen 5 games, as we don't really have much else to do then.

We will also be doing our raffles again as well. For every $5 you get on entry in the raffle every 12 hours, and donations over $10 in total will get you a tax deductible form for your 2013 taxes! My sister will be drawing again on camera for those of you who liked watching her draw. Raffle Prizes Include T-Shirts and Pokemon Merchandise, as well as two drawings from my sister, either digitally or framed and sent right to you! Remember, if you donate early, you get more chances in more raffles, as your donations carry over from the last raffle.

If you have any questions, please ask them here, and I will answer them. I hope to see you guys there. Save the dates! Thank you again /r/pokemon.

Here is the Charity we are supporting
We will be streaming here!
 (I also livestream here about once a day there. If you follow the channel, you will get emails about that)  
I will also be updating on my twitter, here 
And, of course, you can donate here
(You can donate now if you'd like, that way you can guarantee your spot in the Friday Night Raffle)  

Tiny Edit - So they way we were going to do donation only allowed up to have 4 raffles. Instead of that, we are going to do raffles ever 8 hours, so we can have 6 over the coarse of the marathon.

Based on what little I know about X and Y, there seems to be an evolution theme. Xerneas and Yveltal could cause alternate evolutions for existing pokemon, such as Mewtwo's alternate form, which I know is not technically an evolution.
What if Xerneas and Yveltal traveled to Kanto for the next games in generation VI and caused an era of alternate evolution? For example, you could start with a Charmander and it would instead evolve by leveling up into (insert cool alternate evolution here).
One of the first items the player would receive would be a stone that, when held, would cause the pokemon to evolve into their original evolutions by leveling up.
I was thinking that this would be a great way to work some of the awesome fusions into the actual game, although they wouldn't technically be fusions, but would be alternate evolutions. It seems like these games would be a great opportunity to ""power up"" some of the orignal pokemon that currently don't match the power level of the newer pokemon. Hopefully these alternate versions would be a bit cooler than the alternate Mewtwo. :D
Finally, think about how cool an alternate Charizard would be!

Here are my disappointments:
-Starters: I was just really disappointed in the design of the starters. I actually preferred the fan designs.
-Lack of Pokemon: Although I really like the Pokemon they gave us I wish there was more. The whole game I found myself using Pokemon from older generations rather than the new because they were more readily available.
-3D: Lastly is the 3D functionality. It just didn't seem all that good compared to major games that are out now. I know this is the first game in the series for the 3DS so I'll cut it some slack. Oh and I hate how it destroys the frame rate of the game when it's on.
Edit: Online: I hate that there is no 6v6! It drives me nuts! I spend dozens of minutes just trying to find people to battle on the Passerby function. Although I don't mind 3v3, 6v6 makes me need to think more and really use my team as a whole.

Q: When and how were you introduced to the series?
A: In early 1998, I saw a preview of Pokemon in an issue of Nintendo Power and it looked really cool, so I followed more previews until the games were released.
Q: What led you to become a Poketuber?
A: I originally thought it'd be interesting adding a video walkthrough guide to accompany the written walkthrough I had done for my website, so I started recording videos. There wasn't really anyone else doing this back in early 2007 on YouTube. I guess it wasn't so much that I chose the Poketuber life, but rather the Poketuber life chose me!
Q: What is your second favorite behind Marill?
A: Sky Forme Shaymin. I really like it!
Q: What about Marill makes it your favorite?
A: It's hard to say! I have a soft spot for cute Pokemon as well as Water-types, so it's a pretty good fit. Other than that, I'm not really sure!
Q: Do you have any ideas for a new Pokemon?
A: A Fairy-type Pokemon based off of a Koala would be pretty cool, but I don't have anything elaborate to expand upon that.
Q: What is one Pokemon that you think needs a Mega-Evolution
A: Farfetch'd. It'd be awesome!
Q: Would there be a type you would add to the game?
A: I'd like to add the Bird type to the game. Re-type things so things like Pidgey are Bird/Flying (double resistance to Fighting), things like Moltres are Bird/Fire, and things like Charizard stay Fire/Flying. It'd require a lot of re-typing, but I think that could be interesting.
Q: Do/did you watch the anime at all and what do you think of it?
A: I watched the earlier seasons much more than I do now. They were alright. I've started watching the XY anime series and it's rather decent.
Q: If the Pikachu evolution line didn't exist, what Pokemon would be the mascot?
A: I've heard that Clefairy was originally slated to be the mascot, so I guess I'll stick with that.
Q: If you could change 1 thing competitively, what would it be?
A: I would like to see Ghost have more type coverage, particularly offense-wise. It's very redundant with Dark.
Q: If you could add 1 feature to the games, what would it be?
A: It's going to sound silly, but for the various challenges that I do, it would be really helpful to have a toggle for the Exp. Share that you can use to determine which of your Pokemon earns EXP; or, alternately, have an Exp. None item that disables selected Pokemon from gaining EXP (and EVs).

Do you remember how after you beat the Trick Master he leaves his ""job"" of making puzzles to go find himself and hopefully better tricks. Go to the bookshelf and press A. It'll be mostly incomprehensible, but at the end it tells of a Odd Keystone. Immediately after you feel like you're being watched. Obviously the Key Stone is linked to being watched. Now turn on the Dowsing Machine and you'll find an Odd Keystone on the floor; a Spiritomb will attack you. After you fight it, you will no longer feel like you're being watched. Isn't it weird that the Spiritomb was unable to be seen, or ""hidden"" until you found it. Much like the Trick Master. What if the Trick Master went off on a journey all across Hoenn and ended at the Sea Mauville. Unable to find any riddles he deems complexing enough to stump you, he is thrown into a depression and kills himself in the room and becomes a Spiritomb. That explains why the Spiritomb attacks you on sight: it blames you for its death. Finally, after your battle, the Trick Master is finally able pass on to the after life. He realizes that you are truly better than he is, as you can find his any where. Even after death.

Throughout this game I've had tons of experiences where Id throw an ultra ball and get maybe a shake, then for shits throw a pokeball or great ball and get it on the first try.
 I know that seems vague and ""shit happens"". But I caught Rayquaza with the FIRST great ball I threw at it THREE times. (The first two times I caught him I screwed up catching deoxys and shut off my 3ds like an angry child).
Now I know the Snapchat I took of the 3rd and final time I did it was a critical capture, but the first two werent.
And to just add to the ridiculousness I was fed up with tossing ultras at deoxys, so the final time I caught him with ~65% health with a FREAKING POKEBALL. Like a single pokeball I threw just stalling for him to use recover again. (sadly I dont have that one on film, but i can show a pic of the deoxys in pokeball if ya want)
TL:DR : Ive caught tons and tons of high level pokemon throughout this game using just pokeballs and greatballs. While the Ultras havnt helped me at all.

7334	"Chain fishing in ORAS?"	"2"	"6"	"20141201"	"DittroDitto, ditto, motherfucker!"	"Hello, R/pokemon
As most of you should know, in XY, many people have been chain fishing for shinies. The method is to keep getting a hook in the water in the same spot, until you get one. Many of you state that KOing the pokemon is necessary, but for me, it's not,and I'm pretty sure it's the same for all of you too,
I'm not sure if most of you know this, but what I do is just chain and run from every battle, I still got shinies very efficiently in XY in this way. 
Now the question I have though, is whether chain fishing is added in ORAS. With the dexnav and all, I'm pretty sure that you'd have to chain with it, but what about the pokemon in the water you fish for? Is there a similar mechanic or does chain fishing still work?
I have tried fishing for a shiny sharpedo, and I wasn't very successful, but I got 3 feebass on the way. Does any one else know if this feature still works? I don't want to waste my time fishing through the whole game. I used an octillery with suction cups that held a smoke ball.

I presume it's not 100% needed to play the game or get a good Pokemon team so I never bothered before.  I guess it's one of those awesome side things you can do in Pokemon that makes it awesome? xD
Is there a manual or somewhere where I can understand this?  Cause it's really confusing for me lol. And even if I don't really get into doing it I'd like to understand what it is.
EDIT: Thanks for all the replies!  Nice to know that I don't need to do this to have fun with the game :)  but still interesting to know and now those posts about IVs and breeding make more sense to me.

In the timeline as we currently understand it, R/S/E occurred contemporaneously with FR/LG.  That's why you can trade between them--the FR/LG addresses this, too.
We know HG/SS occurs shortly before D/P/PT (based on the Red Gyarados stuff and the compatibility).  I think it's assumed that B/W/2 occurs next, then X/Y.
I'm pretty sure most games address this in terms of trading through ""traveling through time and space.""
But now ORAS appears to be happening at the same time as X/Y.  ORAS has Mega Stones, but it's implied that the characters in X/Y are the first to really understand Mega Evolution, and that Mega Evolution began in Kalos.  I might be wrong about that, though.
So is ORAS taking place in the past, around FR/LG still?  Or has it been moved forward in time?  If so, how do we square the Mega Evolution thing?

I missed Pokemon in my life, i'd given up my original Gameboy before the game was released. But now I sit as an adult gamer, my son is turning nine in a month and a half, and through his friends he's become obsessed with Pokemon (cards, books, artwork, toys, games) and has played some Pokemon Rumble on the WiiU.
But as holidays approach, it's all about the 3DS and Pokemon. (Sidenote, he told me that he knows game systems are expensive, so he's going to ask for the system for Christmas and not his birthday. Needless to say, i'm getting the boy his 3DS and at least 1 Pokemon title for his November birthday).
So, the dreaded question, I know from reading that if I buy him X I don't need to buy him Y to start because how they're similar games with different characters, but as he's 9, I have to ask, where's the jump in point. What does /r/Pokemon think the best jump in point is for a 9 year old boy new to the franchise?

I thought it was such a cool Pokemon. Cute and deadly. By the time I had it at level 77, my little sister started my game over and my wonderful victini was lost forever. 
So today I am online on Pokemon Y and I see that some kid's personal message says ""Victini for Trade"" I needed it. So I invited him to a trade and he kept showing me a budew with the name ""SUICUNE!?"" even though I offered him every legendary I have accumulated over the last few years.So I took it upon myself to go capture a couple bunnelby and pidgey and create the message ""I'll get Suicune, Save Victini for me."" So I proceed to turn on my copy of SoulSilver where I was just about to go to the pokemon league. To make this story a bit shporter, I went through hell tracking down that goddamn Suicune. I started this venture to get victini at about noon or 1:00 PM today. It is now 12:00AM and I just got done about twenty minutes ago. So when I was finally on the last stretch, transferring the suicune to my bank and onto pokemon Y, The fucker had a suicune and got rid of his victini..

Koga is all about messing with the opponent.  He has some questionable strength that might prove a little too frustrating for the opponent, but there are no blatant class cards that are just downright unfair, like ""your opponent discards 3 random cards."", etc.  (That's reserved for another leader, hinthint), so I would like to think the class is at least within the boundaries of Hearthstone philosophy, or at least on the line.  Koga is sneaky, although he doesn't have much direct damage or big hitters. His use of Stealth, Poison (Deathtouch), and Secrets are sure ways for a painful defeat of his opponents.  Secrets are some the hardest cards to make because balancing a delayed effect is difficult and also, how their relationship with one another has to be interesting also makes it challenging for design.  Hopefully I did a reasonable job.
Koga's mechanic is Poison Touch... though I think only 1 minion has this; What makes Koga interesting is his theme rather than his unique mechanic, which makes any minion that is damaged by a minion with Poison Touch gain the Poison status.  Do not confuse Poison Touch with ""Poison"" in Hearthstone, which is worded as ""Destroy any minion damaged by this.""
Koga's Hero Power was originally a 2 cost power, though with how Hearthstone deals with temporary debuffs, it was nerfed to 3 so that it did not completely outshine the Mage's Hero Power.  I could have worded it like, restore 1 health back to that minion at the end of turn, but then again, I try not to be too clunky.

Misty: http://imgur.com/a/94GTb
Lt. Surge: http://imgur.com/a/UaleN
Erika: http://imgur.com/a/22nYr
Bide X: Bide X, during your opponent's turn, take X less damage from all sources.
Soak: A minion that is Soaked deals its damage AFTER the other character when attacking or when it is being attacked.
Channel: When a friendly minion with Channel attacks and survives, gain a Mana Crystal this turn only.
Restore: Unsilence a minion
NEW Poison Touch: Any minion damaged by a minion with Poison Touch gains the Poison Status.

Shared Mechanics
Evolve: Evolve will 'transform' a minion into a new one (It becomes a new minion as far as the game is concerned.) when certain criteria is met.
Paralysis: Whenever you draw a card, if you control a Paralyzed minion, you have a 33% chance of not doing so instead. This effect stacks with multiple friendly minions.
Poison: Minion Enchantment. At the start of EACH turn, this minion takes 1 damage.
Sleep: Can only be given to minions that HAVE NOT attacked yet.  It lasts for 2 turns and has the same effect as freeze.

I'm making 8 new classes with around 25 class cards each based on the original 8 gym leaders from Red and Blue. Thanks for reading!

7427	"Whoever is in charge of the logistics behind this demo needs to be fired (no this isn't a rant on how the US hasn't gotten any details yet)."	"38"	"72"	"20141013"	"bothanspy1337"	"I'm talking about how unfair it is that certain countries are getting more or fairer opportunities than other ones.  For example, several magazines are shipping out codes to their readers.  It's right to assume they have enough codes for each of their readers, right?  Then you have other countries that have only a limited amount and are distributing them online or in store.  What the hell, Nintendo?
Serebii just announced that Spain will be getting, what, 20,000 codes through GAME stores?  Honestly?  How fair is that?  It doesn't make the demo special or whatever the hell kind of message or theme they're trying to associate with it.  They come along and announce it like it's something we're all going to get the opportunity to experience to tide us over for the next month and also discover a new mega on our own without it being shoehorned onto every social media site on the Internet.
Every mega evolution to date has been revealed to me through Reddit.  It spoils all the fun of finding them.  I knew all of the ones in X and Y before the game even released (with the exception of Latios/Latias, but none of us did at that time).
I know that I don't have to go looking on the Internet before this stuff.  But just because Reddit decides that people shouldn't be force-fed spoilers (thanks for the effort, though), doesn't mean that other sites will do the same.  If I don't hear about it here, I'll hear about it form somewhere else.
That was a bit sidetracked, but back to the demo.  Why is it different for every country?  Why don't they just put the goddamn thing on the eShop and be done with it?  Why does it have to be promotional package?  Because that's what it is.  It's an interactive advertisement.  They're giving everyone a reason to go and play the demo and also subscribe to a magazine or pay a visit to GAME or GameStop or wherever.  I'd actually be okay with that¡Xalbeit a bit annoyed¡Xbut still would be able to bear it,  if they would at least make it a fair thing for everyone.  Instead of turning this into a fun countdown to OR/As, they're turning their community into a giant pissing match to see who's going to get the demo.  We're all going to be racing each other to different stores hoping that we'll get a key.  I don't care if you don't get one.  As long as I get one, right?  It hurts to hear, but it's the truth.  You feel the same about me.  What about siblings and friends?  What happens if one sibling is able to get a key, and the other doesn't?  How do you think that would have gone down in your household as a child?
Seriously, Nintendo.  Rethink your strategy because you fucking failed from every possible angle with this ""special event.""  Not only have you failed to inform every territory of their specific event details in a timely manner in a society where everything is everywhere within seconds of it happening, you've also successfully alienated your audience into a pissing match instead of making something very simple and fun for your audience.  You once again proved to me that you fail to understand simple concepts that would give you excellent publicity, and instead twist them into a fucking disaster because you don't understand your audience.
I'm probably not even going to attempt to get a demo.  It's likely going to come out on a weekday here in the US and I'm not about to blow off responsibilities for 15 minutes of fun.
EDIT (to all of those who think that this is uncalled for and am ""entitled""):
How exactly is this overrating or a fit of rage?  They announce this thing like a month ago and pretend everyone's getting one.  Then within the past week or so we learn that it's a very limited distribution exclusive to the few who's schedules can get them to a store early enough in the morning or are able to afford a magazine subscription.
If they had been more upfront and said that this is a limited demo only a small number of fans will get to enjoy, I wouldn't have been nearly as angry.  But I was really looking forward for once having the opportunity to check out a game early.  Smash Bros. did it and if I do say so myself, was a very big success.  Sure, you can only pay it 30 times, but it did what it was supposed to do and give you something to tide you over until the game came out.  There's no reason why they had to make this a limited distribution and pretend for a month prior that it was a simple thing we were all going to get to enjoy.
I'm allowed to be upset for false advertising without being called entitled.

There are two quite literally across the street from each other in my city, and there's one I always go to just because it's in a bigger shopping center I frequent, whereas the other one is in a tiny strip mall I usually forget about.
I go in and tell the guy behind the counter I'd like to get one of the codes, and immediately asks if I have ORAS pre-ordered. I tell him no, and he says I have to have one to get a code (and that one was needed for the Pinsir/Hercross event last month) I tell him I'm pretty sure you don't need a pre-order to get it. He insists that I do, that some email came out from corporate and blah blah blah (a bunch of fake-sounding BS). ""You have to read the fine print"" was how he finished. I told him I did, and that multiple sites say no pre-order is needed. He still insists I do, so I walked out.
As I was leaving the shopping center, I left out of one of the exits near the other GameStop. I decide to go over and try my luck. I walk in and the guy behind the counter asks how he can help me. I start with ""I'm hearing some conflicting things about picking up a Shiny Gengar code.""
That's all I had to say, and the guy was like ""oh yeah, let me get you one!""
""No pre-order needed?""
""No, I don't know why other stores are saying you need one. They're free."" The guy cut a fresh package of them open and handed me one. I told him I'd be doing any future GameStop business with his store from now on, and I'd be sure to let everyone I know do the same.
I know this has been said a million times before, but  do not let a GameStop employee tell you a pre-order is needed to get your code. Not trying to clog the sub up or anything, but wanted to let people know that GameStops are trying to tell people a pre-order is needed, and that they most definitely aren't!
EDIT: As /u/fritzys_paradigm has pointed out, GameStop has a post on their own Facebook page about the distribution which clearly states NO PURCHASE NECESSARY. I just checked it out and it's right there. If anyone give you flack, be sure to point this out. If I'd known this sooner I would definitely have shown the guy I dealt with!

Kanto-I'm not a genwunner by any stretch of the imagination, but my first game was Pokemon Blue and without Kanto I would not be a Pokemon fan today.
Unova-I thought it introduced a ton of fresh pokemon into the mix, I loved the urban setting, and I thought the whole storyline with N and Ghetsis was fascinating.
Hoenn- Again a region with tons of new pokemon, plus I love the tropical setting and I thought this region had the second best starters after Kanto.
Johto- I preordered both Silver and Gold when they were released, but I was not a huge fan of the starters and I just didn't like the design of many of the new Pokemon released in this generation.
Sinnoh- The starter pokemon for this region were pretty good, but I didn't think there was enough access to new Pokemon and the Elite four was pretty weak, although I did think Cynthia was one of the best champions of the series.

For abilities, he'd hopefully get something to counteract that Fairy Weakness, maybe some sort of Thick Fat ability or something.

7488	"Don't forget about abilities... [a tragic tale]"	"4"	"15"	"20150105"	"CowboyBoats"	"So I'm down to my last 2 Pokemon about to face Diantha (not for the first time; this is just a casual swing at the Elite 4 mainly for mega-stone-buying money). Things aren't so bad, as my last 2 Pokemon are a level 75 Charizard holding Charizardite Y, and a level 85 Venusaur.
However, in a twist, I do not have tons of PP left. Charizard knows Heat Wave (2 PP remaining), Flamethrower (0 PP), Roost, and Toxic, and Venusaur knows Giga Drain (2 PP), Synthesis, Sleep Powder, and Growth. (Look I'm not saying I'm a great player or anything; that's just what they know). So actually, I only have four attacks left, and Diantha has six Pokemon, but whatever, let's see what happens.
I open with Venusaur who drops Hawlucha, but it takes two Giga Drains. I know I should have opened with Growth spam, but I already knew I was going to be using Struggle and I sort of just wanted to get down to it.
Aurorus comes out and I switch to Charizard. However, a Thunder makes contact and Charizard (previously weakened) goes down.
So Venusaur is back in it. However, Venusaur is holding Black Sludge, so he's not necessarily going down soon. 

I Growth up until Venusaur's Attack and Special Attack can't rise anymore.
I weather a couple of Blizzards with no special effort from Venusaur.
I get rid of the remaining Sleep Powder and Synthesis PP, expecting to be able  to Struggle soon.
Apparently they fixed the bug I remember from Gen I where NPC Pokemon never lose any PP, because Aurorus has switched to Thunder against Venusaur, who is barely noticing it.

So at this point, all but one of my PP are gone. The last PP is a Sleep Powder, which Aurorus is able to avoid. Then Aurorus lands a Thunder, which does minimal damage... but it paralyzes Venusaur! Oh no! I check my bag to see if I have Paralyze Heal.
So I'm browsing through my berries, and I read the description on Leppa Berry for obviously the first time ever.
It restores 10 PP of any move! I am kicking myself! I was sitting here taking Blizzards and using Growth 20 times, when I could have just used it five times and then Giga Drained my way to victory.
I dose Venusaur with Paralyze Heal and the Leppa Berry for Giga Drain. So Venusaur is at full health, with 10 Giga Drain PPs and no other PP, no status condition, and max Attack and, more importantly, Special Attack. I Giga Drain against Aurorus and obviously it instantly goes down. I don't really remember what comes next, but there are only four Pokemon remaining on Diantha's team so obviously they're getting Giga Drained to death by the max-special-attack Venusaur.
So then Diantha sends her Goodra out...

I've tried asking on the original homepass thread nearly a month ago but no one replied, and I am almost to give up on this freaking goddamn event.

Sylveon@Pixie Plate
Pixilate
Modest
252 HP, 126 Sp Def, 126 Sp Att
Hyper Voice
Pyshock
Shadow Ball
Calm Mind
I've been tweaking my team here or there, but current it's Meinshao lead, Klefki to setup, Kingdra, Talonflame, and Mega Manectric to round it out.
Due to Ground covering her weaknesses to Steel and Poison, I've been working on breeding the perfect Eevee with HP Ground.
However, I'm thinking of slightly adjusting my Sylveon. (Without knowing the full setup of the rest of my team) what do you think of this setup:
Sylveon@Leftovers
Pixilate
Modest nature
252 HP, 252 Def, 6 Speed
Hyper Voice
Calm Mind
HP Ground
Wish
Sylveon is usually awesome for me, but her biggest problems are her low speed and low defense. By investing her EVs into defense, but also maintaining Modest, along with Calm Mind, I should bulk her up a little bit, but still allow her to do some great damage as she was before.
I would still likely take her out whenever she faces a Steel or Poison type - the HP Ground will come in handy most of the time when she comes in against a Dragon, Dark or Fighting, and they do a very predictable switch out. I could HP Ground into their new guy then maybe swap out.
Typically I've seen bulkier defense Sylveons or all Offensive Sylveons, but I haven't seem something quite like this (or at least online in my searching)
What do you guys think?
(P.S. I'm not trying to say that this is a brand new idea never thought of before... I just hadn't seen it anywhere in Sylveon build ideas. Maybe that's because it's not too popular, or maybe it's because the setup wouldn't work well!)

The World Travel Clip (WTC), a small electronic device similar to the pokewalker of heart gold and soul silver, will not only count steps but using a built in gps receiver it will track your distance covered. Additionally while in areas of fitness like gyms and areas of social interaction like arcades and shopping districts the players will gain additional travel points and rewards. These points can be spent to buy items including a new set of evolution stones with the catch that the items and points cannot be traded or used on any other game cartridge or digital copy.
After eight months and many more to come, Game Freak will map out most of Tokyo and all major cities around the world identifying fitness centers, sporting facilities, and other locations of interest. While it will debut with Pokemon 01 and Pokemon 10, Game Freak plans to develop the map further with Nintendo to add a new dimension to future RPG, sport, and fitness titles. Through an online profile players will be able to add a limited number of points of interest which after confirmed will be added to the global map. Creator Satoshi Tajiri hopes that this new feature will help encourage players to go outside where they can have more social interactions and by doing so try to reduce the rapidly growing hikikomori problem Japan is facing. While working on developing this system Tajiri also wanted to incorporate exercise/fitness into it seeing it as a great way to combat world obesity at the same time.
While the WTC will not be required to complete the game, there will be some optional content that requires the WTC as well as some new evolutions which require WTC only items. Two new evolutions inspired by this revolutionary game mechanic have been released with this announcement.

Would be cool if we can do this for other events.

So, I've sort of grasped at straws here, but I'm wondering if they'll introduce a new region in ORAS. I know it's unheard of, but I don't think it's as unlikely as, say, patching X and Y with more content other than a few Pokemon.
.
REASONING:
In a recent episode of the X and Y anime, Diantha is mentioned as having traveled to a distant, unexplored region, named Guipna.
Guipna looks sort of like Guinea (this is by far the weakest part of my argument, so it's unfortunate it's also the first jump you have to make).
French Guinea is a FRENCH colony with a notable part to play in the European space industry.
Going to space has been a recurring theme in Pokemon games.
The Strange Souvenir looks like the statues from Easter Island, which is somewhat close to South America. You know, only about 3,000 miles away. (oops)
We've not had mention of a new region in previous games, making the Strange Souvenir incident exceptional and notable.
Guipna is largely unexplored. French Guinea is largely populated on the coast, and the interior is largely undeveloped.
.
Basically, I have no hard evidence. It is entirely speculation, and straw grasping, but it's fun for me to sit here and guess away my life. I mean, I really am grasping at straws here, so if you think there's no way in hell--hey, you're not alone. I've just really wanted a South American-based Region for so long. j_j

After ten years of play and more than 400 hours it finally gave in. Some of the happiest times of my childhood were spent roaming the Johto landscape, surfing through the whirlpool islands, passing through Ilex forest or climbing Mt Silver, I remember them all fondly. It was the game I was closest to completing the pokedex while only missing azumarill, entei, raikou and celebi. My feraligatr, my starter, was my first lvl 100 and one of my proudest accomplishments; it was with him that I learned the duplication glitch and my first success with it. Watching my friends tremble to the power of my twin lvl 100 feraligatrs was amazing! But when my lugia's data was destroyed, from a duplication error I swore I would never use it again. It was this game where I learned that if you look behind ever corner you might not expect what you'll find; whether it be finding lapras in the Union Cave, headbutting tree after tree to find heracross or discovering togepi's evolution, there was always more for me to explore and discover. I know this isn't the most interesting posts but this game meant a lot to me and it seemed fitting to give it a proper send off. Thanks for reading

The egg hatcher would allow you to instantly hatch an egg, but it runs on play coins. This way instead of holding down my thumb for thirty minutes, i could take a thirty minute walk. The idea really sounded cool to me, even though i doubt it could be in OR/AS or any other game for that matter. Thoughts?

I'm guessing that maybe they utilized the infrared sensors to send only certain events (like moves) to a machine in the center which instead simulates the battle instead of actually capturing it.

This esteemed Professor, Samuel Oak, spoke to me directly through the pixelated words that exclaimed themselves from the data of my very first videogame, Pokemon Blue Version. How was I, a ¡§rookie trainer,¡¨ to know which starting Pokemon would be the best to choose?
Nintendo released the game about a year before I convinced my parents to get it for me. My friends, however, were not as unfortunate as myself. They brought their games, still wrapped in the plastic wrappers, and viciously paraded them before my craving eyes. Eventually, they freed the games from their plastic prison, and, after blowing in the red or blue cartridges, popped them into their Gameboy Colors. 
Needless to say, I had watched wide-eyed as the opening title flashed visions of grandeur into my mind. Even as my friends typed their names into the game, answering Professor Oak¡¦s first question, I could just imagine myself typing ¡§superwailord¡¨ into the blanks. After all, there were just enough blanks to fit my full name. The empty slot beckoned to me.
Now, after Professor Oak rescued me from the fatal mistake of walking into the tall grass (where everyone knows the wild Pokemon are lurking), I faced the digital table with three Pokeballs on top. My rival stood to the side, complaining to his grandpa, the Professor, that I was allowed to choose my partner first.
I browsed each ball, looking hard at each potential candidate. I had heard and seen so much about each: Bulbasaur, a Pokemon resembling a dinosaur with a seed on its back; Charmander, a fiery lizard that evolved into a ferocious dragon; and finally Squirtle, the turtle that eventually developed into a tank-like beast of a tortoise. Each was so unique, carrying a trait that I wanted for my own partner.
My friends sat around me, urging me to pick their own favorites. 
¡§Pick Charmander! He¡¦s like, the only good fire type Pokemon!¡¨
¡§No way! Bulbasaur tears up the field! Nothing can stand against him!¡¨
¡§You guys are all crazy. Squirtle can beat any of those guys!¡¨
Their chatter went on like this for some time. I couldn¡¦t help but imagine myself with each Pokemon, just as my friends were describing. If I had Bulbasaur, I would have a powerhouse of a grass type, but after reading about strategy, grass types did have multiple weaknesses and were incredibly slow. With Charmander as my right hand, I could easily dominate quite a few trainers, but being a fire-type left me at a disadvantage when it came to the vast plethora of water-type Pokemon found in the game. Having Squirtle would give me a strong water-type base for a team, but it would leave me vulnerable to any electric-attacks that I knew could be devastating to any aquatic monster.
After hearing the pros and cons of each choice, my friends eventually persuaded me from choosing Bulbasaur, and suddenly I felt backed into a corner. While just moments before I had all of the confidence that I would choose correctly, I worried that I would choose wrong. 
All around me, the words of my friends suddenly turned into a muddled mantle of confusion in my mind. Which one was actually better? Their opinions swirled around inside my head, causing me to pause for several minutes on the screen. 
A thought edged its way through the cloud of turmoil in my mind. It spoke to me clearly, almost causing the clamor in my head to subside.  After the noise had subsided, it whispered to me: if they choose your first Pokemon, it won¡¦t be your own. This rang, echoing in my now empty head for what seemed like a lifetime. 
Unconsciously, my thumb moved my player in front of one of the Pokeballs and clicked the A button. I heard the moans of dismay, as well as shouts of celebrations as my friends realized which starter I had chosen. I glanced down, now happy that I had decided against allowing myself to be swept away by my friends¡¦ opinions. After all, Squirtle and I had to make our way towards the Pokemon League on our own.
TL;DR: Squirtle Squad for life #raisesomeshell

Tonight was the night of initiation. The initiation into the Pokemon club of Shitsville, Wisconsin. Dan had brought his playing board and all 67 decks of cards he had. Only 10 minutes after Dan arrived, all the other 3 arrived as well. The leaders of the PCOS (Pokemon club of Shitsville) arrived as well. 
The pledges has gone through multiple weeks of hazing, including homosexual acts, but tonight was gonna be the worst. The worst of the worst, the worstest. 
""Alright you fucking scrubs, to begin tonight's ceremony, run around the entire warehouse 169 times while chanting in unison 'we are scrubs, we love snorlax'."", the leader, Rob announced to the trio of pledges. They got to work immediately. 
Ten minutes later they were done, tomato faced and breathing like a type 2 diabetic, oh wait, they were type 2 diabetics. Rob the leader, pulled from a small bookbag 3 leashes and collars. 
""DO YOU WANT TO BE A PART OF PCOS?""
""Yes sir!"" They responded with obedience.
""THEN PUT THESE ON YOU FUCKIN SCUM""
They each put on a collar and leash. Each leader grabbed a pledge's leash and kicked them to their knees, making them walk like dogs. It smelled unpleasant in the warehouse, the pledges had already shit themselves 6 times. They were bathing in their own shit. 
After multiple hours of embarrassment it was time for the final ceremony. The leaders lit candles and began preparing. In the middle of the circle of candles, each leader placed a single Master-Ultra-Infinite card in the shape of a triangle. After chanting quietly 'Oh Lord master of Pokemon we summon you', 45 times, shit got real. The earth beneath them began to shake. The pledges began to get frightened, but remained in their seats. 
A large crack spread through the center of the candles, suddenly, a Japanese man in black robes erupted through the earth, causing a loud crash of falling debris. The Japanese man began speaking Japanese to one of the leaders. The leader nodded his head in a agreement and turned around, facing the pledges. He grabbed Dan and threw him on the ground. The Japanese man took off his robe to reveal a naked Japanese man. The Japanese man showed no mercy, he got right to work. He removed Dan's shit stained jeans to reveal a shit stained asshole. For the japanese man, the shit would act as lube. All so suddenly the japanese man stood up, and swan dived straight into Dan's ass hole, plunging head first. Somehow Dan lived, although he was nearly dead. The Japanese man had fully entered Dan's body, now having full control over him. Dan's anal leakage was heavy, however his spirits weren't. He pulled through. Suddenly, Dan felt the Japanese man's very essence rub on him. Dan could now speak fluent Japanese and remember all of the Pokemon. With this new power Dan decided he would save the world and rid it of anyone who disliked Pokemon. No one expected it but Dan was special, he had a special gene. Dan felt the power and began to contract, shoving the japanese man back out of his asshole. Dan's eyes rolled to the back of his head and when they came back, they were poke balls. Dan looked around at everyone in the warehouse, they were ecstatic. In one swift motion Dan did a fucking spinning jump roundhouse and clobbered every single person's heads off. He grabbed them and began to weave a saddle out of their carcasses. Dan was now God. A pterodactyl in golden medieval armor crashed through the roof of the warehouse, Dan mounted the bird, using the human saddle, and flew off into the nearby city. He planned on destroying the world and rebuilding it, using genetically modified animals as pokemon. It was Dan's dream, and he'll be damned if he didn't accomplish it.

"5"	"11"	"20150216"	"El_Barto_227Ninetales Best Tails"	"We know that there are two moves it the code that are suspiciously similar to Zygarde's Land's Wrath move (Ground Type, 90BP, 10PP, 100ACC, acts like Earthquake but does not hit allies) but with added effects: Thousand Arrows can hit flying foes and knocks them down, while Thousand Waves traps the opponents hit. He was also just kinda there, catchable but not fleshed out much like Kyurem, who got focused on in B2W2.
I think that the next GenVI game will the the XY third game/sequel, and Zygarde will get a mega or formes which utilize these moves. Since he's supposed to  stop Xerneas and Yveltal, they might tie into these in some way.

Ok, so my goal is to get my legendary dream team, which consists of: Mewtwo, Mew, Arceus, Rayquaza, Giratina, and Palkia for Omega Ruby. I managed to get Rayquaza, Mewtwo, and Palkia. Arceus and Giratina isn't that hard to get if I buy Pokemon Diamond. So I think you all know my problem, Mew... I rather leave trading to a last resort and I won't ever cheat. So after some research, I came up with some questions to obtain my missing legendary pokemon that I need help answering.
1 - I have a Wii U, can I download and use Pokemon Ranch on that? Or do I need a Wii (I have a Wii also, if I cannot use Wii U)
2 - I have a 3DS XL and the New 3DS XL, can I play Pokemon Diamond on it and use it with Pokemon Ranch, or do I need an original DS?
3 - The lowest gen pokemon game I have is Pokemon X, so in order to get these pokemon from Diamond, I need Poke Transporter and Poke Transfer, if I also buy Pokemon Black 2, can all of this be done on a 3DS?
4 - Can Pal Park (Diamond) be useful in catching a Mew? I have no idea how Pal Park works, but if it's easier than using Pokemon Ranch and getting 1000 Pokemon, I'm down for it.
5 - My plan is to use Pokemon Ranch with Diamond and obtain Mew from that, then the other legendarys from Diamond. Then I will use Poke Transfer and Poke Transporter to move them to Omega Ruby using a 3DS for all of it. Is that flawed in any way?
Thanks for reading and trying to help :)

7753	"ORAS PseudoNuzlocke / WonderLocke / MonoRun / Different gameplays! V4"	"5"	"9"	"20141201"	"RaphaGetHigh"	"Hey guys, i saw some interesting ideas here to make the gameplay a bit funny, and I wanted to know if someone have more ideas! I'll try to list all the ones i can in this post, so maybe i can inspire people (and our EU frens that can't play yet) to do any of them when they start playing or finally buy the games! Ok, the ones i know are kinda basic but still, I think it's cool:
---- ALL THE IDEAS AND RULES ARENT MANDATORY, YOU CAN ALTER/CHANGE/IGNORE THEM IN A WAY THAT SUITS BEST YOUR STYLE, THE INTENTION HERE IS TO GIVE OPTIONS FOR YOU GUYS -----
GENERAL RULE: You cannot enter a gym with more pokemon than the leader has and/or cannot use any pokemon with a higher level 3lvls higher than their highest level poke(this balance things up, suggestion from /u/27th-wonder).

Speed Run: Consists in, as the name says, going trough the game as fast as possible. So normally you'll skip unnecessary parts/items/pokemons and only care about it post-game. No secrets here
Solo Run: Just saw a post of someone doing this, sounds interesting for the ones wanting a challenge: It's basically going trough the whole game with only one pokemon (I think it's ok having HM slaves, but you avoid battling with them or just keep them at a low lvl). Two options here: 1. You can't evolve your pokemon. (someone made me realize that your poke will be overleveled doing this, so this makes it challenging instead of easier xD) OR 2. You have to challenge the game without training in the grass, just encounters while you're walking to somewhere (so you basically can only fight wild pokemon in the way to the place you're going without walking around just to train your pokes), trainers and the gym leaders.
PseudoNuzlocke: I also saw this idea here, that is: You can only catch the first pokemon you find on the routes,either by walking or sneaking (but you can't search for a specific poke, just the first one that appears, if you make it run then u catch one walking in the grass normally). OPTIONAL if a pokemon faints, he's dead and you must put it on the pc foreva or you can wondertrade it(one time, you must keep the poke you get unless you already have it or one of it's evolutions) This will make a really odd team and can be kinda fun too :D 
Wonderlocke (/u/BloodyHonedge idea in my point of view): Kinda the same as the pseudo Nuzlocke, but only with wondertrade.. You wonder trade your starter and ONLY ONE poke you catch, then you may catch and wondertrade ONE poke per gym, then it's your call using it or leaving him on the box. Counting the starter + all the WT's, you'll get 10 pokes before E4. Then you may catch and wondertrade 3 more pokes before E4 and then decide your final team with this 13 posbbile pokes (legends are not allowed to make it fun :p ). If you obtain a duplicate pokemon from Wonder Trade, you may wonder trade it back off.  If you gain a pokemon that is too high leveled and won't listen to you in your first 2 trades, you may wonder trade it back off.
Nuzlocke? The only idea i had to do something really random includes the need of pokebank + already beaten ORAS/XY. Basically you open 6 random number generators, roll them from 1 to 719, breed the results and start a new game with the result :D
DexNav Challenge (/u/DerpQuake idea): You must catch every pokemon in a route before moving on. Simple as that. Pretty useful for people who just bought the first pokemon game, i did this in X (last one i played bf that was FRLG) and completed the national dex in 2 months with the help of some reddits and GTS (not sure if it's slow or fast, for me was damn fast as i was never able to do it in previous games, and i didnt had much time to play)
Lowest level Elite 4 (/u/LeagueOfVideo idea) - Beat the elite 4 as low leveled as possible. Maybe someone will manage to do it with all level 1s.
Duel Locke (/u/LeagueOfVideo idea and i put another option too) - Each player has an x amount of time to start a new game and get their team as strong as possible. You battle each other after the time limit is reached. Or you can start the game at the same time, and by the time the first one beats the E4, the other stops playing and after the credits and the battle with your rival, you battle each other.
Mono Type runs (/u/drouillard110 idea): You can catch as many as you want, but you can only use pokemon that have the type you chose. You can send the first pokemon via pokebank Actually i took some time to calc and there's some types that doesn't even have 6 pokes before you get the national dex, so sending only one poke to start may be unfair for some types. You can send up to 3 pokes if you choose Ice,Fairy,Ghost,Fire,Fight or Electric, 2 if Steel,Poison,Bug,Dark,Dragon or Ground or 1 if you choose Grass,Water,Normal,Flying,Psychic or Rock, BUT in max at lvl5 to be a fair game(breed it :D). I think i'll do it with the shiny beldum we received and a klink xD 
Egglocke(/u/astrocartog idea + some stuff i came up with): You create a topic on reddit or a pokemon forum that you know ppl will answer you asking for RANDOM eggs, and you put in the description to people don't write the egg they'll send you, so other people sending eggs can't build a team for you looking to the other eggs. Put your FC there and be online so you can receive the eggs when ppl trade with you. Once you have 6 eggs, hatch 3 of them and start playing :D the last 3, you hatch one after beating each gym (So you'll have the 6 pokes for fighting the 4th gym, i think this makes it a bit funnier bc then you don't lose hours and hours on the beggining training ALL the low levels) other way to do this is create comments in the post named ""poke1, poke2,etc"" until poke6, then you breed yourself the first option of each comment,assuming you have a living dex and another X/Y/ORAS game to breed. HM SLAVE CLAUSE: If any of the pokes you got can't learn an essential HM (Like Surf or Cut), you can pick one poke to be your HM slave for that game, but he must really be a HM slave (meaning don't choose a poke to be HM slave bc it cover a hole in your team, choose a crappy one like linoone for Cut,Rock Smash and Surf for example).
Ash Ketchum Run(/u/Wandering_Poet Idea + some changes I made): You may catch ONLY ONE pokemon per route(Doesn't sounds like him but for the gameplay it works better or it wil be too easy). After every gym you have to box one Pokemon from your party and release one Pokemon except your starter. The Pokemon can't just be the lowest leveler Pokemon on your team NEITHER the last one you caught/added to your team.  If you lose to a gym leader, you have to change in that gym one of the 2 higher level pokes in your team with one of your box that has lower level than the one you're taking off (Gym change rules still aply, as he'll be the newest member you still can't change the selected poke if you beat the gym in the 2nd time you try.) [Ash trains his pokes if he lose, and just leveling up if you lose sounds a bit boring/obvious]. Finally, you only have one chance to beat the Elite 4 with your final team (You may change one poke and release other bf going,E4 counts as a gym here). If you don't beat them on your first go, then you must release every poke in that team, and only try again with the pokes you have in the box from the previous gyms/catched during the gameplay. (maybe you can keep your starter for the AK pattern still be real, but he'll probably be overleveled at that time, so your call). If you run out of pokes, you lose and restart it again (Sounds pretty cool actually, I'm trying this one for sure)
ADD : When you finish any of these runs, you choose one pokemon of your team, you can train it a little bit more, then you go trough E4 all over again. You cannot use any items to heal your pokemon of health or status. You cannot save your game until after you have beaten the champion. (/u/Guapscotch idea)

What do you guys think? Any other ideas of gameplays that could be nice putting here? Any 'upgrade',things u didnt liked or better ideas in the gameplays i wrote? I'm up to suggestions and i'm planning to test all of them, so let's make this things a thing :D haha
EDIT: I started these days a Ghost-type run with Honedge and Litwick (following the rules above, as there's tecnically only 5 ghost-type pokes before E4 on ORAS), it's being really cool until now :D just won against liza and tate :D I beat the E4 :D the first 2 were a bit hard but a couple revives and I was fine :p Stil have the 2nd row when they have higher levels to finally finish it o/

For Gen 7 I would love to see new evolutionary families be accessible only through breeding two specific types of pokemon and not available elsewhere.  They could be hybrid types like the mashups we see so often... so for example a new Bee line of pokemon would be available only by breeding a Vespiqueen with a Beedrill... etc.  
There would be an endless number of potential combinations and actually have players seeking out pokemon other than ditto to breed with, plus there would be the added challenge of needing specific genders.    Maybe only a female or male version of a pokemon when paired with another gender would produce the new evolutionary line's egg... or maybe you have a low percentage of even getting the new evolutionary line, say a 25% shot.
You could even have some tough to acheive pairings like Electrive and Magmortar produce a new electric/fire type pokemon egg.
has this ever been discussed before?

And I got a Shiny Spiritomb on Wonder Trade on X/Y that's from a Friend Safari from some French dude.
I've got a few of my friends Trio Shinies that I know he cloned and probably traded to me. But I don't technically mind because Shiny Legendary's are obtainable very easily plus no one would really care so I kept them..
But then I started using the QR method for NORMAL Obtainable Pokemon. 
I started picking up more and more until after a while, the little red star began to lose it's meaning. The shock of actually find one in the wild and catching it. 
At first I was telling my self ""Meh..it's to much actual work to get COMPETITIVE Shinies..so I don't really care.."" But I felt like I took a short cut..
I don't knock anyone for doing it. If you want to no big deal.
But I felt like Fempomila (Shiny Ambipom) was just pushed aside from being the real gem she was.
This isn't a post to play on any one's conscious or stop the use of QR codes. 
Just has been on my mind recently. Any who I'm getting rid of majority of my QR Pokes.
I'm still sending out legit looking baby Shiny's. I sent out a box full of Shiny Level 5 Riolu's for Wonder Trade Early. Lots of people sent me ""Thanks"". Twas nice to know I made someone happy with the Shiny they got.
Because I'm sorta the same way. If I get a Shiny VIA trade/wonder trade and it looks legit enough, I'd be extremely happy.

I'm sorry if my lyrics might not appeal but they're the best I have and I tried to make sure they fit with the original song =)  You can try to help me fix it if you want, since this is a rough draft!
Song One: Thinkin' Bout You By Frank Ocean (Opening)
Original
A tornado flew around my room before you came
Excuse the mess it made, it usually doesn't rain
In Southern California, much like Arizona
My-eyes-don't-shed-tears, but, boy, they pour
When I'm thinkin' 'bout you (ooh, no, no, no)
I been thinkin' 'bout you (you know, know, know)
I been thinkin' 'bout you
Do you think about me still?
Do you, do you?
Pokemonitized
A Tornadus demolished my team before you came
Excuse the mess it made, there's normally no rain
In X and Y, unlike in Gen 5
With hel-la Poli-toeds running around.
When I am spamming you ((ooh, no, no, no)
I've been spamming you (you know, know, know)
And now you are in OU
Are you enjoying it still?
Are you? Are you?
Try singing it to the original song!
OR 
Song Two: Habits by Tove Lo (Chorus)
You're gone and I gotta stay
High all the time
To keep you off my mind
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
High all the time
To keep you off my mind
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Spend my days locked in a haze
Trying to forget you babe
I fall back down
Gotta stay high all my life
To forget I'm missing you
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Pokemonitized
You're up and I gotta use
Taunt, all the time
To keep you from Calm Mind
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Taunt, all the time
To keep you from Calm Mind
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Spending my days spamming Haze
Trying to make you faint
My rating goes down (Note: I mean Battle Spot Ranking)
Gotta use Taunt all my life
To prevent your Slack Offs too
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Thanks for putting up with my rough draft lol

Almost every night i dream that im playing pokemon and find shinies and/or legends in the wild, like shiny Gyarados at lv 98 in some patches of grass...
Recently i have been having dreams of finding shinies in hordes, some of them were really crazy like legendaries in the middle of them. In one of my dreams, i found a Swablu horde with a shiny swablu and a shiny swirlix and then i received a phone call from Professor Oak saying that i don't have the pokeball aiming upgrade yet and laughed at me.
Last night, in my dream, i found a horde of Froslass with a Shiny Giratina in it and used Selfdestruct. Then i woke up screaming ""noooooooooo"" 
So, anyone here had some of these weird dreams and want to share the story?

This morning, I found them in the same condition; the pokemon in my party were completely cured (although the pokemon in my box still had it).
Is there a reason this would happen?  If it makes a difference, this disease came from gen 5 - I transfered it through pokebank.  And I doubt this would matter, but the places I saved for the night were the SS Anne and New Mauville.  How can I get pokerus to ""stick""?

Yes, I know as old as Pokemon is now, more kids and teens who are girls are now into it. But growing up, from 1998 up until maybe 2009 or 2010 (Gen 4), I had never seen a single woman into Pokemon. Not even Asian/Japanese American girls. 
And then, I went to Pokemon Symphonic Evolutions and saw more than one female over the age of 18, there. (Not saying ""over eighteen"" to imply anything sexual.) I wonder, where were all these female trainers when I was growing up? Even today, it still seems quite rare, though. I'd say it's about the ""one in seven ratio"", like trying to find a female Eevee or starter. Only it's with real life female trainers. But maybe I'm wrong.
I'm just curious, is it just me, or have other people never met an ""old school"" female Pokemon player/trainer, before. Or is this only limited to my experiences? A girl who plays Pokemon more than casually - not just a fan of the anime and/or manga - and was born before 1992 or some really young year like that. (Also, keep in mind, there are exceptions to every rule, so I'd be more interested in the cases where it's not just a one out of a thousand chance that you happened to know a girl trainer in the real world. I'd want to know about instances of meeting more than just one of 'em, especially if you yourself aren't female.)

So, strategy one would be a team of all-fast Pokemon, IVs into Speed and Attack, with Shadow Sneak and Sucker Punch and then backup or status moves.
Strategy two would be a team of slower tanks with IVs into DEF and HP, deliberately trying to tank the initial hit and then retaliate with Shadow Claw, Dark Pulse, or Shadow Ball, simply doing enough to ensure a OHKO.

While, Ho oh does the same thing but move the enemy entrapped in it to the floor but first, Ho oh flies up and then to the background. On the other hand, Entie, just stands there and then uses it. The way that it was timed Entie used and finished his attack. Right at that point Ho oh used his attack.

Well I don't know about you guys but I have a feeling that they will pull off another Pokemon move like they did in the 90's and I bet it's going to be called Pokemon Z.
OK so this is how I see it playing out:
The playing cards will be digital this time and on smartphones and tablets.
The Pokemon show will be on Netflix for the fact that they have well over 50 million subscribers and most of them are the Millennial Generation aka the Pokemon Generation.
And of course Nintendo will still make the main game on their own hardware.

I was born in the late 90's (90's kids will understand (¡E.¢X) ) and grew up with a Gameboy Colour as my only way to play video games. Grandma gave me the handheld and Pokemon Crystal before I could read, but it didn't stop me from walking aimlessly around Golden Rod on the save file my brother generously played for me. 
Enough sentimental bull shit. I've been around the series for a while and have, for the most part, been first hand to witness every large step the series has taken. 
I think X / Y were shit.
No, not shit games. The Pokemon gameplay mechanics are still there in their extremely sturdy nature. But the atmosphere of the universe 15 years in the making was gone.
Writing was just plain goofy. Pokemon games have always had over the top narratives with Pokemon thieves and conflicts of global proportion, but gens I - V just contained better written characters. It's not even that the older games were written in an attempt to appeal to a mature audience, Pokemon games have always been kid friendly. Five minutes into the game, the circle jerking bunch of characters surrounding my character felt like plastic. Yes, I am older now than I was back in the good ol' days, but put any gen I - IV game side to side with X or Y and tell me the narrative on a smaller scale isn't corny as fuck.
Nintendo got battles very right, and although I am about to criticize the graphical engine, I can admit that the engine thrived at displaying the turn based battles themselves. 
But when we look at the over world, things aren't quite as polished. Much like the leap from Link to the Past to Ocarina of Time in the LoZ series, the game sacrificed a certain amount of graphical cleanliness and general aesthetic purity for the sake of a third dimension. In the end it worked out well for the gaming industry, and no one is complaining. 
But OoT revolutionized controls in the third dimension. X and Y.... ARE STILL PLAYED IN 2 FUCKING DIMENSIONS. The world feels empty when observed from a non isometric view, and the tiled pixel art of the early 2000's feels better to look at than a game that, being generous, looks like an early PS2 game. This aesthetic sacrifice did not accomplish anything gameplay wise. 
The decision seems odd to me only because after releasing a dozen or so rounds of Pokemon games for two decades, each of which looked better in two dimensions than the last, they scrapped all progress to build a game in a mediocre looking 3D universe that a handheld, prided on stereoscopic 3D, can't even handle most of the time. The industry these days is becoming more and more about polygon counts and it is doing more harm than good, as more and more effort and resource are placed on time intensive textures and models. Quality over quantity, sure, but as we become more attached to the raw technical strength of games we are going to continue to get less content for the same buck.
Now, onto difficulty. I understand a lot of people here are in to Pokemon for the endgame, so the tools at hand during the campaign aren't of much concern to you. We live in a world of pay to win models and gamed that reward players for either very shallow time investment (clash of clans) or investment of USD (clash of clans). Of course Pokemon isn't pay to win, but all the O-Powers and Pokemon petting fluff just scream bad game design to me. ""The game needs to appeal to a wider audience ya dee dah dee dah"". I get that, but Pokemon games have always been quite fair and quite well paced. The fun of the damn games is the grind and the sense of growth, why replace that with handouts to make an easy game easier?
I know the game did plenty right, and y'all can counter my attacks if you think my claims can't be ratified. Just wanted to share some sour tastes in my mouth. Cheers!

You can't eat Pizza, bacon, or bread since they look too much like land.
Then thing closest to land you can go to is sand at the beach.
You can't use Steel, Ground, Rock, Fire types since they all pertain to the ground. (Any other type is fair game.)
You must drink overwhelmingly amounts of liquids to sustain for not eating any of the items listed in number one.
You can't climb mountains. ( you'd be interfering with Rayquasa doing that.)
Water types are weak to electric type pokemon and can't learn learn earthquake since it's ground types.
Swimming is the only type of sport you can.
Where do you sleep? Certainly not on land!
You can't go into restaurants since there on land. 
If you do run out of your fresh water supply, you can't drink the ocean water since it's too salty.

We are a competitive Reddit league consisting of 18 Gym Leaders, one for each type.  There are many leagues similar to ours out there, but we stand out in a number of ways: 

Each season we gather challengers to compete to defeat us and earn our badges.  Those obtaining 11 badges get to face off at the Victory Road champions tournament for the crown of Pokemon Axis Champion!
We are not entirely based off Smogon OU rules, but have a strong basis on them.  Many bans are similar, but some differ.  For example, Mega Mawile is not banned in our league, but is in Smogo OU. Check out our Wiki for more on the rules, bans, and clauses.
Become a gym leader!  That's right, between each season we look for the most active members to become our leaders for the next season!  Also, anyone can run their own casual gym!  It doesn't need to be a type, it can be a clown gym (Mr. Mime and Conkledurr), a color coded gym (all red Pokemon), anything you desire!  This option opens up possibilities for those that are more casual instead of competitive.
Your team is consisted of 8 Pokemon!  This allows challengers to swap Pokemon around to find the best fit for each situation.  So be ready to register with a team of 8 (item clause still applies to the 6 used in each battle).
Our very own irc chat room: come chat with us to learn about the league!  Our Reddit page has all the information regarding that.
Are you not very well learned in the competitive scene?  Not a Problem!  We will help you learn, and even have casual gyms you can battle to learn the meta game and hone your skills!
We always encourage creativity in teams, so try to think outside the basic Smogon OU box.  Remember, you only have to defeat 11 gyms to get into the Champions tourney, but their may be prizes for beating all 18!

So what are you waiting for?  Sign up today for Season 4!  Sign Ups are HERE

Streaked Tenrec. This thing screams Electric type.
Warthog. Would make an interesting Groud type with a lot of speed potential.
Platypus. Could be Flying, Water, Psychic, Ground, Rock, Electric or Poison Type and it's uniqueness could easily make a cool Pokemon.
Indricotherium. Most likely would be a Rock Type. Would possibly have amazing bulk too.
Platybelodon. Perfect Ground Type candidate.
Chalicotherium. Fighting, Grass and Normal would all fit the bill for this one.
Rockhopper Penguin. Rock, Ground, Water could be potential for these, and Electric could also be an interesting type.
Lammergeier. Being a Vulture, Dark, Fire, Poison and Flying are all potential types.
Shoebill. Has a potential for Dark and Flying.
Hornbill. Could be anything from Fire, Psychic, Water, Electric, Grass, Flying and Steel
Frigate Bird. Could potentially be the first non legendary pure Flying type.
Cassowary. Would work well as a Fighting Type.
Dinosaurs. Lots to pick from, but they're representation in Pokemon is very minimal
Marine Iguana. Could be a Water, Grass or Fire Type
Gorgonopsid. This thing has a lot of potential, especially with Dark, Ground, Rock, Steel and Fire.
Dimetrodon. Grass and Fire could work well with this.
Diplocaulus. Water, Flying and Ground could be very good types for this creature.

If you don't know what Geocaching is, then here:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geocaching
Simple outdoor game where you use your GPS to find hidden devices in all kinds of places that a lot of people participate in.
I'm planning on doing this on a smaller scale in our town, the nearby towns, and the trails and parks using Pokemon trading cards.
I'm looking into creating simple modified TCG rules so they can actually battle wild pokemon to capture them, and even have the kids battle each other before they actually do get enough cards for a full deck.
This isn't a one day event, I was thinking it might be a weekly thing where I'll hide a card somewhere in town and they all have a chance of catching a pokemon weekly.
Here are some fun ideas I have for this:

I hide a card (or maybe just an image of the pokemon and I'll have the card with me so there is no chance of losing it), take a picture of the area it's hidden with the geotag enabled, and then the kids will use a map to get to the area (park, trail, street), and try to find it with the coordinates and a gps app.
When they find it, they have to battle it with their starting pokemon and attempt to catch it by weakening it, or whatever other options they have in their deck, then maybe roll a die to see if the catch it (the weaker they make it the more likely they are to catch it).
Once they catch it, they add the pokemon and any other cards it comes with (energy cards, maybe a trainer) to their deck.
Thinking of having them log the battles so I can figure out a way to have the kids win evolution cards.
Still organizing a way the kids can earn pokeballs (to catch pokemon with) and trainer cards to add to the deck.
I'm going to buy a set of gym badges that I've seen online and have some friends and family play as Gym leaders

This is the extend of my planning, but if anyone has any ideas for other fun things to add or maybe a better way to implement this, I'd love to hear it.

However, if these three groups all had separate genetic pools and breeding populations (via domestic isolation in this case,) they could be called subspecies.  Here's an example of real biological subspecies: http://larryfrolich.com/Evolution/ranges_map.jpg
In general, as far as ""battle"" and ""contest"" subspecies go, I think the term ""breed"" is more appropriate here, because each animal that was bred was not necessarily selected from a unique group of animals (and not necessarily isolated from the other subspecies groups.)  In fact, I would argue that, in the Pokemon world, trainers take great pride out of breeding animals that they themselves have caught from the wild, which do not represent a separate genetic pool.
tl;dr.  we should stop using the term subspecies to refer to Pokemon bred for ""battle"" or ""contest"" unless we are referring to groups that:
1) have become isolated from each other
2) no longer interbreed and
3) each have their own unique ancestors originating from the initial species (which has since begun to subdivide).

8011	"They're back."	"2"	"4"	"20150209"	"littleazndae"	"Day 42, we still don't know who's behind all this. If it wasn't for the mayor calling me every hour, it would make the hundreds of people swarming the precinct every day slightly more bearable. I have to admit I'm starting to get worried as well. After all, I have a Charmeleon at home and my son is expecting an Eevee for his 10th birthday next month.
68 high value Pokemon were targeted and forced to evolve within the span of four hours. The attack was unprecedented. These unknown assailants came into the night and used evolutionary stones to make seemingly random Pokemon forcibly evolve. Nearly all the Pokemon targeted were from breeders and that was no surprise. This had to be planned. How did they know which stones to use? Where did they even get them all?
There was a small theft in Geosenge Town a few months back, but that couldn't account for even a third of the stones used here. It doesn't make sense. Where did they get the manpower to pull this off? Or better yet, the money?
There hasn't been another attack since that night, but people are scared. Nobody is going out into the wild anymore and merchants are scamming trainers with fake Everstones in all this panic. Trainers with evolutionary stones in their private collections are being arrested all over Vermillion City. 
But what is the point of all this attack? There needs to be a reason. There hasn't been a ransom, threat...nothing.
There was a loud knock at the door.
""Sir, I have something to report.""
A familiar face strolled through the door with a tight grip in her right hand.
I bellowed, ""Dammit Jenny! This better be good. I'm sick of all these calls and I want this handled now!""
That might have been unnecessary, but I need Jenny to understand that time isn't helping. The wild is getting wilder and nobody is out there to tame it.
Jenny slipped a smile and cracked opened her hand to something shiny. It was a fragment of a Sun Stone.
""How...how did you get this?""
Jenny replied, ""It was floating near one of the western ships and a kid saw it from the dock. He panicked when he realized what it was after picking it up and then called me.""
I asked, ""Did the kid see anything else?""
Jenny quipped, ""No sir. But this all makes sense, doesn't it? They're on board the ships sir. That's why we couldn't find anything for so long.""
Jenny handed over the Sun Stone fragment and I smoothed my hands over it to make sure it was real.
Jenny exclaimed, ""Team Aqua! It has to be them. Nothing else makes sense.""
I muttered, ""Thank you, Jenny. That will be all.""
I dismissed her accusation, but it did make sense. When half of your city is a port, a water gang is bound to start creeping in. I guess they're expanding.
I started to write a warrant just in case. Time to rally up the troops and comb through those ships. We need more clues...more evidence. Doing things by the book lately has been difficult, but it's been getting results so one more time wouldn't hurt.
Before my pen could touch the paper, the phone started ringing again.
Dammit. Is it too much to ask for one day of peace?
I picked up the phone and a familiar voice was on the other line.
""Hey boss. Did you miss us?"" she asked.
""You...you're dead. How is this possible?!"" I panicked.
She turned a corner of a smile. ""I guess you didn't try hard enough. You better prepare for trouble...""
""...and make it double.""
The second voice faded away as the former gym leader gripped his chair.
They're back.

8108	"More information on obtaining an extra Destiny Knot"	"7"	"2"	"20140721"	"Vitreousjudge#REKT"	"So if any of you are like me and for whatever reason, lost, sold, or misplaced your original Destiny Bond and want to start breeding and are looking for another one, I'll explain a bit more in-depth on how to get one.
I'm sure most of you have searched on YouTube and used Google, and all you ever come up with is the beauty in Lumiose City. Now this works for some people, seeing as she has a chance to be there and sometimes she doesn't.
I've read plenty of comments in forums and on YouTube videos, asking whether the npc spawns on time of day, well luckily she doesn't! So, let me try to explain as best as I can, on how to make her spawn. 
Firstly, you will need to know that there is probably multiple npcs in that part of Lumiose that you can battle with the prefix ""beauty"" although only one of them actually gives you the Destiny Knot (I know for sure one gives you an elixir).
The beauty that gives you he Destiny Knot will be found close to the Pokemon Center on the South Boulevard. The easiest way to get there is to fly to the south region of Lumiose City and as soon as you land in front of the Pokemon Center, turn left and head past the first big path, up until you see a blue taxi. Right before you get to the blue taxi there should be a small alley to your left, that is where the beauty is that gives your the Destiny Knot after defeating her (If you are confused by these instructions, check out a YouTube video on it, she always spawns in the same spot).
Now this is where it becomes a bit unclear for some, she isn't always there. but there are many trainers around the area that you can fight to help spawn different npcs, including her. The best way to do this is by riding through each alley and looking for npcs to fight. If you go to an alley and it black screens, as if you are entering a new area or a building, you have gone to far. You should be able to navigate around the area of trainers without actually leaving the area (it's fairly large, much more then you would think. For example, the first alley you walk into, leads to a statue, while two ladies chat. You will notice that if you take a right from there and continue going, you won't zone out, rather you will find another statue with two guys talking. All you have to do is keep navigating around these areas, without zoning to another part of town and looking for npcs to fight in the alleys (some alleys are small and very tucked away, those generally have people to battle.
You just battle a few trainers, and check back on the south part of Lumiose, where you came from and check to see if she has spawned. If not keep battling, luckily for me I only had to battle about 3 trainers before she spawned.
Hope this helps, if there's any confusion, or questions, feel free to ask. I'll try my best to answer them. Good luck getting your Destiny Knot's!

Anyway, I managed to beat Crasher Wake in Platinum (lv33 Gyarados, lv37 Floatzel, lv34 Quagsire) with a lv26 Rotom, lv24 Scyther,  lv25 Gabite, lv25 Bronzor, lv24 Grotle, lv 23 Starly, and only three fresh waters, no other items. Most of the pokemon in my party were slow-moving one-hit kills for Crasher Wake's pokemon. I just thought it was cool and wanted to share.
It was pretty gnarly. I don't know if anyone else low-levels these things, but it's fun as hell, and if you follow the rules above you'll get a good challenge without getting stuck (generally). If I do get stuck, I usually backtrack and tackle trainers I avoided until I gain one level with each pokemon that is relevant to the upcoming battle, then try again.

"1"	"1"	"20150302"	"shypan"	"I was just thinking of the Pokemon card game, where your benched Pokemon can have like...Pokemon Powers I think they're called? And they actually affect the Pokemon in play... and I think you can guess where I'm going with this.
What if the Pokemon you didn't have in play granted passive bonuses to the Pokemon that ARE out in the field... but you can only get those bonuses when they're not in play. 
The obvious issue is that things can get pretty complex if its 6 v 6. So what if these bonuses weren't as complicated as abilities go...  maybe just simple things like a 5% Attack Boost, and the same passive abilities can't stack. Nothing OP like team-wide Sheer Force or something.
Or maybe there would be an item that a Pokemon could hold that would activate the passive ability, and it was up to you to decide whether sacrificing a a potentially helpful item for a single Pokemon is worth having a small bonus to the whole team. 
And maybe these passives could even work if the Pokemon was fainted?
Or maybe the passive isn't attached to the Pokemon, maybe just hold items themselves? 
I feel like there are still a lot of holes in this idea. I just want to know what people think though, or what passive abilities you've come up with or would like to see.

Edit: I will add NSFW in case some people don't like creepy facts or maybe for young children that use this subreddit.
1: Actually, a lot of Pokemon are creepy. Psyduck has a chronic migraine which gives it psychic powers but thrashes its memory.
2: Parasect is a crab corpse being animated by a fungus. 
3: Cubone wears its mom's skull as a helmet.
4: Shedinja is said to take the soul of a fool who peers down the hole in its back.
Banette was originally a doll. But after its owner threw it away, it came back to life and now seeks the owner who abandoned it.
5: There was an episode about Hypno taking the children away
6: Gengar is actually a dead Clefairy
7: If you slow down Shaymin's in game cry, you can slightly hear '' thank you ''
8: Banette may look like any old mischievous creature, it's important to note that it's described as being, ""possessed with pure hatred,"" and are supposedly dolls that children threw away. Because of these two facts, Banettes constantly wander around urban areas and seek out the ones who discarded them in order to haunt them.

Gorgeous graphics and details
Overall, the music remixes were executed better than HG/SS and FR/LG
Improved characters and dialogue. 
The DexNav is a powerful and amazingly fun feature.

Cons:

Extremely easy story mode, except the Elite Four. Even without EXP share, I thought the game was a joke. The gym leaders lacked the challenging teams from Emerald version and routes felt empty as they removed the trainers from Emerald as well.
Short development cycle, they didn't even fix the frame rate issues. 
Post-game is a joke, there's nothing to do after legendaries (which I already had) and Delta. Battle Frontier could have saved this disappointment of a game.
It lacked the passion that was put into the FR/LG and HG/SS remakes (gameplay wise, I agree the presentation of the region was great) to expand what made the games good and add more meaningful, long-lasting content on top of that. 

I'd give this a 6/10, it was much better than X/Y but it didn't accomplish as much as I hoped. If Gamefreak doesn't make a comeback by at least throwing a bone to hardcore fans of the series with the next Gen 6 title, I am done.

To be a Committee Head means to lead a sector of the game's development. There are 6 committees in need of heads:

Art & Design
Game Art
Game Dev
Music
Story & Concept
Region & Geography

As with Phase 1, registration is still open to the public.

Recently, when my roommate saw me fighting one, he asked what I was doing, and I explained the method as the threads had. He immediately looked disgusted, calling this act ""cheating"" and exploitation of the game.
I had to disagree with him, for the following reasons:
-Everyone has access to this method
-Levels matter very little, if at all, in competitive play
-EXP grinding has long been one of the most monotonous aspects of Pokemon, taking up much of player's postgame time and keeping them from playing the more entertaining and competitive sides of the game.
I want to see what /r/pokemon thinks about this.
TL;DR: Is using QR codes to grind for experience ""cheating?""

Pro like bro. Emphasis goes on this syllable

In like the direction.
I realize arguing pronunciation when it comes to Pokemon is a bit silly, but this isn't like Arceus where there's fifty officially-valid pronunciations. Protean is a real word with a specific pronunciation, and that pronunciation is NOT ""protein.""

8247	"Does anyone here remember Hacked Pokemon Series?"	"11"	"16"	"20150511"	"gurdijak"	"For a long time on YouTube, there have been groups of people who have established entire series by hacking Pokemon games, most common were those on the GBA such as FireRed and Emerald. The purpose of these hacked series were to create and establish a story, not a playable game.
Many people established their own direct stories with these hacks, often even including other hackers as characters in them. For example, TrainerDor, creator of the Water Pokemon Legend hack series which has been rebooted many times, included hackers BankaiKris - formerly RockOnKris - and Koga (Can't find a link to his channel, since he closed his first one down and I'm not sure what happened to his second channel), the latter of which had his own 'Fire Pokemon Legend' hack series.
Unfortunately, this trend died out. Among the most common reasons were hackers retiring after being unable to find creative inspiration to continue their works and copyright strikes. The former happened to one of my favourite hackers, TrainerDor. He had a successful 'Water Pokemon Legend' series that had originally ran for more than 100 episodes and also established its own mythos, so to speak. After uploading 100 episodes, he decided to - for whatever reason - reboot his series. This proved to be a bad decision, as he then rebooted it one more time...and another. After this, TrainerDor ended up retiring, sadly.
Regarding copyright strikes, various hackers were struck with these because of the use of copyrighted music, as many had began to take anime influences, even developing anime-style intros for their series. Many even took inspiration from games. GoldFinale, for instance, had a series heavily influenced by the game series Kingdom Hearts.
The reason why I'm writing this to the subreddit is because these series were something which were, in an odd way, close to my heart. I was young when I watched this and was amazed by how they were able to develop such interesting stories and characters. I really want to know, though, if you guys ever used to watch any of these series and what you think of them.
I will list a few known hackers or former hackers below, as I recommend you give them a try. This is not to advertise them, but rather to share an important relic in how these beloved Pokemon games have influenced all of us in one way or another. Who knows, maybe they will inspire one of you to be the next great hacker.

TrainerDor (Retired)
BankaiKris/RockOnKris (Inactive for 2+ years, seemingly retired. Youtube active 2 weeks ago)
GoldFinale/GoldsAdventureStorys (Last active 3 months ago, but posted a comment on Sanna Collier's channel a week ago)
SharkJamez (Retired. YouTube active 2 months ago)
HackinJohn (Retired, to my knowledge. Inactive for 3+ years)
ShadowElliot (Last active 10 months ago. YouTube active 8 months ago)
TamashiiHiroka Yeah, you heard that right. Before she become a general Pokemon Youtuber, TamashiiHiroka had a hacked series as well as posted tutorials. (Retired from hacking, active on main channel here)
Sanna Collier (Inactive for 10 months, YouTube active 4 days ago)
BlazikenMaster (Still active, though doesn't get much views)
Uthtube (Still active)
While not a hacker, ElliottAdventure has an interesting Pokemon sprite comic that's also quite funny.

EDIT: So I just sent a quick comment to BlazikenMaster, asking him if he's been in contact with any other hackers. He said TrainerDor's long gone from the internet but still talks to Gold frequently. Just thought people might want to know.

"0"	"4"	"20150511"	"eitheroreither"	"So this was posted about 3 years ago by another redditor, which is where I got the idea (http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/pdnu6/got_my_boyfriend_the_eight_gym_badges_from_the/).
I want to do a similar thing, and think of 8 challenges he can do, preferably related to the name/element of each badge, and I was hoping to get some fresh ideas to the ones on the original post. Thought the populace of Reddit might have some different ideas after three years!
The trouble is, over our 4th Anniversary, we're on holiday with his family in the Lake District, UK. There will be some privacy, so sexual challenges are cool, but otherwise am somewhat restricted with challenges due to company and doing 'activities' most days - probably lots of dog walks, and only whatever additional items I'd need that I can take in a suitcase and still hide from him until the day.
We live in the UK so alcoholic challenges are welcome, although we are both students so expense is an issue, plus I doubt we'd be able to get anywhere to drink seriously on this holiday/will be getting drunk with the family.
The only thing I can think of immediately is for the Boulder badge - to climb a mountain/large hill. He enjoys rock scrambling on walks so that will be a fairly easy one to accomplish in the Lake District methinks.
Perhaps an oiled sensual massage with fingering for the Cascade badge as well - I'd say that fits? Or perhaps anal (lube = water)?
I was tempted to take his game and console along so I can give him each badge as he completes each gym but I know he's already aced the game several times so technically I should just give them to him by this logic! Also I don't especially want to lose him to Pokemon for a chunk of the holiday!
I've also thought about battling him using the same Pokemon as each Gym Leader, but he is much better than me so I feel there would be no challenge whatsoever in doing that!
So! Thoughts Reddit? Throw 'em at me! :)
The link to buy the badges is http://sanshee.com/store/product/gym-badges-generation-1 for everyone that wants them!
TL;DR: 1st Gen Pokemon badges-related challenges for BF for anniversary while on holiday with his parents.

8253	"A Personal Pokemon Tragedy"	"5"	"5"	"20150323"	"Iscariot_X"	"I recently went through a terrible time with regard to Pokemon and I thought it might be a tad therapeutic to share my story and get feedback from individuals who may have suffered something similar.
Recently I moved far from my home and, on my own in a new city, I turned to my longtime love of Pokemon for comfort. With the release of ORAS, I began reliving the love I had for Gen 3 in my youth. After beating the game I didn't know what to do with myself, so I did something I never had before. I became competitive. I learned everything I could about the mechanics of the game, about the finer points of breeding and training and I set about my work. I poured countless hours into breeding, training, and battling with my new pokemon in the pursuit of reaching a new level of skill and building a perfect team. More importantly, I was going to put my childhood rival to shame with my newfound skills. 
I was doing well. I was thrilled with my team and the progress of my abilities. I decided to do what I never had. I finally completed the national pokedex. I drew from all of my games and did some strategic online trades and finally did what had been my mission since I was 5. I caught them all. 
Then it happened. I was out with friends getting dinner and drinks. I had my 3DS is my coat pocket for the commute. I had a good time out, but, on the way home, I took out the 3DS and the game cartridge wasn't in my system. I panicked. I had no idea how it could have happened. I retraced my steps that night and the next day. Asking the staff of every establishment I had been  if they had found it. No luck. My game, all my pokemon, all I had achieved was gone. 
I was distraught. Luckily most of my pokemon were safe in the pokemon bank. But not my team. I've tried to rebuild since and have rebred the raw materials for my team in Y, but my heart isn't in it. To make matters worse. Recently, my 3DS, after years of good service, has broken. The casing has cracked and the top screen has ceased functioning. I have tried to pull all the important mons out of the bank using only the bottom screen search functionality, but I know I will be losing a lot of them whenever I wind up getting a new 3DS. 
It seems like at the moment of my greatest and most satisfying achievement with pokemon, everything that could go wrong has. Has anyone else ever experienced this kind of misfortune? 
I still love Pokemon, but for right now I feel like I need to distance myself a bit and I just don't know how I can even begin to rebuild. Any thought, suggestions, stories? I would appreciate the solidarity.

Birthmas). Needless to say, this is the most generous gift I received from any friend, ever. I owe him a lot, and I want to repay him.
Here's his generous gift, in case you don't believe me. If you look closely you can still see the plastic on both of the games.
There's a bit of a story that goes along with our friendship and how it ties into Pokemon, so bear with me:
We met back in grade 1 (for me) and 2 (for him - he's a year older than me). We were in a split class together, so both grades were being taught as one class. One day during gym class, we ended up running into each other, and were mildly hurt. After being sent inside, we began talking, and soon discovered that we both were in love with Pokemon; he had Red version and I had Yellow at the time (yes, we're old). Every day after that for the rest of the year we would eat/sleep/live Pokemon together. 
We would train, trade, battle, and capture Pokemon together on a daily basis. Some of my best childhood memories are from the adventures we shared in the land of Pokemon. Times like when I hid my gameboy in my desk because I was mid-battle with Agatha and needed his advice. Or when my gameboy fell onto pavement as we were mid-way through Mewtwo's cave, and both of us had a mini heart attack, only to find that not only was the gameboy ok, but that the game hadn't shut off either. Or that time when I caught Rayquaza with a Pokeball ... twice. 
Years passed, as did generations of games, and one thing has never changed about our friendship: our love for Pokemon. We've conquered some very rough times together, and it has always been one constant that we can turn to. That's why his gift meant so much to me, and why I want to repay him. We have been friends for over 15 years now ¡V and it all started because of Pokemon.
I already have one part of his present done, which was attaining multiple of his favourite shiny Pokemon (thanks again to /u/thankyoubasedjosh ): Click here to see
I want to repay him by getting some artwork done. I am not talented in visual arts by any means, but I think it would mean a lot to him to have an epic drawing done by someone who is actually adept. I am willing to pay a fee/give reddit gold, whichever you prefer.
So here's what I was thinking:
A picture of us with our two favourite Pokemon from way back - Jolteon for him, Vaporeon for me. I was thinking we could be posed like we were taking a photo, one arm around each others shoulder and then have our respective Pokemon beside us (arm on/around/petting/doesn't matter).
It would be ideal if this was drawn in an Anime style. I will provide a physical description of us, and/or pictures to the person who is willing help. I am looking for a somewhat professional quality drawing (that's why I don't mind paying a fee).
Feel free to inbox me or comment if you can draw well or if you can point me to someone who can! Thank you!
tl;dr
My best friend bought me a 3DS, Alpha Sapphire and Ocarina for Chistmas/Birthday.
We met each other and became best friends because of Pokemon, and have been friends for over 15 years now.
I want to partially repay him by getting a drawing done of us with our two favourite Pokemon from back in the day, but I suck at drawing and need someone's help to do it. I am looking for a drawing of us, as if we were getting a photo taken with a Jolteon beside him and a Vaporeon beside me.
Whoever can help will be provided a physical description/pictures of us (don't want to just put photos out there). I am willing to pay a fee and/or reddit gold.

I thought ""Release"" would get it out for me to use, because I was like 6 and didn't know what ""Withdraw"" meant yet. There's strike one.
That one, he got over. At least I think. But what he didn't get over was me defeating Zapdos and saving it. He was getting mad because he couldn't catch it, so he took a break and gave it to me. I battled Zapdos and defeated it in a few moves. I remember thinking, ""Wow, that was easy."" I saved it and handed it back to him, and he was sooooo mad.
To this day, he's still salty and any mention of it is bound to start an argument.

Anyway, I've been trying to match my team to Red's (Blastoise, Charizard, Venesaur, Snorlax, Pikachu and Lapras (although I replaced Lapras with Dragonite)), and I couldn't actually get two of the starters until I got surf. So now that I have surf, I'm stuck with a few low level Pokemon just before entering Victory Road, and I'm having trouble getting through. Also I need money for supplies.
Is there anywhere in Pokemon Red that I can go to level up relatively quickly before entering Victory Road, ideally while making some money? So far looks like I'll just have to fight some higher-level wild Pokemon, but that's taking forever.
If this isn't the right place for this, I'd appreciate it if you could point me in the right direction.
Thanks!

And I'm here to announce that we're starting a friendly season that's going to take place during the summer :3 every month June, July, August will be a different meta on showdown where all the battles will take place. The challenges are as follows 
June: colors
July: Almost Any Ability
August: little cup
so starting soon will be colors :D this is where you make a team of pokemon all of which share a color. Here are the specific rules to mono color.

Battles are VGC doubles, all standard rules apply 
the pokemon's body must be ~30% of the chosen color 
Leaders are restricted to their type but can't use their type's official color (if you don't know what that is, google pokemon types and click on the bulbapedia link) so fire can't use orange, Fighting can't use red, water & ice can't use blue, etc...
Shiny Pokemon count as being a different color. so a shiny starmie can be on a blue team 
for pokemon that change color upon mega evolving only the base pokemon counts. so a regular orange charizard can't be used on a black team even though zard x is black how ever zard x can be used on an orange team cause charizard is orange if that makes sense :3.

just a reminder this isn't going to replace the regular league challenge so you won't earn gym badges for doing this. this is just for fun interaction with the leaders and challengers 
Also while the challenges can be made in this thread or our sub reddit we strongly advise that you try to use our mibbit chatroom the channel is #secretbaseleague. However if you don't want to use the mibbit site then the server is irc.mibbit.net and then use the same channel and you're good to go :D
so I hope you guys will enjoy our challenges this summer and can also taking on our league Hope to see you guys out their :D

I think that the gen a game gets remade is equal to the gen that it came from times two. I'm somewhat expecting a Gen 1 remake in Gen 7 to be that gens remake, because I think Sinnoh will be remade in Gen 8. Gen 2 was remade in Gen 4, and 3 in 6, so why not 4 in 8, 5 in 10, 6 in 12, etc? This works for remade regions to get another chance as well, because each time a game is remade for the first time, the next Gen will be open. Gen 7 could have a Gen 1 remake or sequel, Gen 9 could have Gen 2, Gen 11 could have... nothing (to reflect Gen 5), Gen 13 could have Gen 3, etc.
TL;DR Maybe remakes are even numbers (Original Gen # * 2) and reremakes/sequels could have odd (Remake Gen # * 2+1)

8432	"Please welcome our FOUR new moderators!"	"79"	"89"	"20150209"	"bigslothonmyfaceLoafing around![M]"	"Hello all! After much deliberation over nearly 200 moderator applications, we're pleased to welcome four new mods to our community! They are:
/u/Dragon_Claw
Hi /r/Pokemon! It's awesome to be able to be a part of a Reddit community for something I really enjoy. I've been playing Pokemon since it existed and got into Competitive a few years ago. Even rising up and becoming a Gym Leader over at /r/PokemonLeague3DS! As cheesy as it sounds, Pokemon has been a big part of my life for quite a while. So I'm really looking forward to helping out the community as best I can.
I'm currently spending time in the big sandbox, so I've got a good amount of time on my hands. I'll always be down to schedule a battle and happy answer anyone that asks questions. Be it Pokemon related or not. And as always, don't forget to have fun!
/u/Ferretsroq
I¡¦m very excited to be a new addition to the /r/pokemon moderation team. Some of you may know me as part of the admin team for the recent Inaugural /r/pokemon Tournament, and for stepping in on some competitive discussions around the sub¡Kor for my undying love of Weedle.  I¡¦m a competitive player at heart, despite what my elo on Showdown might represent at the moment. I¡¦m honored to be invited to join the team, and I¡¦m looking forward to this new role.
/u/Katsuro_Naginata
Hey everyone, my name is Katsuro and im a 20 year old professional concept artist as well as a university senior. Im also quite outgoing and do charitable work or even hikes whilst im not on reddit. Im glad to have been picked as a moderator and I hope that well have an excellent time together :)
/u/TownIdiot25
Hello everybody! Its an honor to be in this position, and I hope to have a lot of fun doing this job. I am a college student, and have loved Pokemon since I was 5. My favorite type is Dragon, my favorite of which being Dragonite. I have experience running/modding subreddits this size, but I know this will still be a unique experience. PRAISE HELIX!

Please congratulate our new mods! We're delighted to have them on board. 
On a more somber note, we're sorry to say that former moderator /u/dhanraj123 resigned unexpectedly yesterday. We're sorry to see him go, and we wish him all the best! Fortunately, the overwhelming number of excellent applications we received allowed us to quickly fill the empty space.
To those who weren't picked: never fear! We'll recruit mods again in the future.

We're also announcing a few rule and policy changes in response to the feedback threads (here and here) that we've posted in the last month.
First off, we're adding two new rules in response to the poll we conducted over the past few days (results here):

Posts about Pokemon received via Wonder Trade will be removed and redirected to /r/WonderTrade
Posts about winning the in-game lottery will be removed

As you can see from the poll results, we had a pretty clear mandate to make rules regarding those posts. However, we also had a clear mandate NOT to ban posts about Pokedex completion or posts asking which version of a game to buy!
For those asking why those four topics were singled out in particular, read back through the feedback threads -- all four came up in those!

Additionally, we're making three changes to our sticky thread rotation, again in response to the feedback threads:

The popular ""noob questions"" thread will now be included TWICE in the sticky rotation, instead of just once.

Also, the most recent noob thread will always be featured at the top of the sidebar, under the Wiki link. Many people suggested making the noob thread more permanent, and this is our attempt to do it!

We're adding a new ""hype thread"" to the rotation!

This thread will be a sort of ""positive version"" of the rage thread, where users can brag about in-game accomplishments, promote their work, and share happy Poke-related stories.

The feedback thread will only appear in every other rotation.

This is due to a sharp decline in the number of comments between the two threads, and to allow changes some time to sink in.

Thanks to everyone for your feedback and mod applications! /r/pokemon is a wonderful community -- let's keep it that way.

8434	"Advices to surmount a broken emerald savegame"	"3"	"5"	"20150209"	"beykex"	"So, my little brother surprised me yesterday when he showed me a Pokemon Emerald cartridge he just bought on a garage sale. Despite me having told him about rip-offs, he decided to buy it just in case it had some good mons and items to transfer them via D/P --> B/W --> XY, and...
...What a shame when we found out an average savegame from someone named JESUS (quite prophetic imo) in the Battle frontier with just... 35 mons in the dex, with no items (not even Exp. Share), no TMs, no money, and only 35 pokemon registered in the Pokedex, only with Groudon, Kyogre, Rayquaza (both three at lv 70 with surf/dive/cut/strength taught!!!), Sceptile (lv50), Swellow (lv40) and Manectric (lv30) (and I guess the rest of the mons got released).
I inmediately discarded this being a speedrun due to 50 hours of gameplay when first beaten the E4. I've deduced this cartridge belonged to a kid (proof: those HM slave legendaries + I found a rare candy attached to Swellow) who miraculously managed to beat the E4 six times with low-leveled pokemon by abusing of healing items (that'd be the reason why no items/TMs/money), and that in the best-case scenario he got to transfer some pokemon to a Gen IV game instead of releasing them.
In any case, everything is sadly broken: we had only 300 pokedollars, not even enough for buying balls/going to the safari, there are no pokemon in the boxes, it seems every item was taken (I checked wether the player was given EXP. Share, and he did, and he sold it...). I've tried to grind Manectric and Swellow in some routes but it's incredibly tedious without Exp. Share. I got to beat the first two guys from the E4 and earn a bit of money as well.
My question is: what kind of things come to your minds in order to improve the situation and, at least, being able to fill the Dex and building up some teams to participate in the Battle frontier?
Thanks to everyone who took the time to read my story and to tell their ideas!
TL;DR: I got an Emerald cartridge from a garage sale with a messy savegame without money, items and good mons. Ideas to improve the situation?

"0"	"4"	"20150209"	"cybertroyano"	"As a good catch of 17 year olds, I grew my early years playing first with my gameboy advance and later with my ds. I remember the first pokemon game I bought was Emerald, and I'm pretty sure I never got to finish it. I forgot about the games, and just casually would watch the TV show, out of boredom, but nothing else. When Diamond/pearl came out, I already had my r4 (in case you don't know, it was those micro SD cards where you can put some cracked games and stuff) and downloaded Diamond and completed it.
This was a little backstory explaining  whats my little to no experience with pokemon and, even though I haven't played that much, I could probably name a good 95% of the pokemons from I to IV gen if I got to see a picture of them.
Thing is I have little idea about the mechanics of the game, let alone competitive play (since I've never been able to play online after all) and I would like to get serious in the pokeworld. I guess I'd like to know which game should I buy to start off my adventure and then proceed from there.
As a side note, I'm a completionist, so after I got started with whichever game I god recommended, I'd probably buy any game I needed to get to 100%, and even get into serious trading for it.
That said, all I'm asking is a few tips on how should I start if I want to become as much of a pokemon master as any of y'all.
Thanks in advance!

For those of you who are unfamiliar with the Prisoner's Dilemma you can read up about it here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoner's_dilemma.
This is from a purely theoretical point of view, and does not take into account peoples acknowledgment of the greater good and anything like that.
This is how it relates to Wonder Trade.
Suppose I am training with a trainer, call them Red (who I cannot see/contact). Suppose I have a Bidoof and a Jirachi and Red has a Zigzagoon and a Mew. There are four possible trade combinations.
Case 1: I put in a Bidoof and Red puts in a Zigzagoon. In this case, I am disappointed because this isn't very excited, but at least I didn't lose anything. 
Case 2: I put in a Bidoof and Red puts in a Mew. This is the optimal case for me. I receive the super rare Mew and all I lost was a Bidoof.
Case 3: I put in Jirachi and Red puts in a Mew. I still get a Mew, which is great, but I had to give up my Jirachi. The reward is the same, but the cost is much higher. The fact that I put in a Jirachi did not increase the likely hood of getting a Mew.
Case 4: I put in Jirachi and Red puts in a Zigzagoon. This is the worst case for me as I have lost a Jirachi and gained essentially nothing.
Economically speaking it makes no sense for you to put anything more than the most common Pokemon into Wonder Trade as you get nothing extra in return. Since, you do not build karma points or increase your chance of getting a better Pokemon, you are always best off my minimizing your own personal cost.

I just want to know of the biting moves which Pokemon would actually do the most damage with one? 
Update: so far we've found that Crawdaunt with choice band + Adaptability + Adamant + base 120 Attack has a slightly stronger Crunch than Mega-Sharpedo's crunch; Making the Lobster technically the strongest biter in the game because the description of Crunch according to Bulbapedia is ""The user crunches up the target with sharp fangs. This may also lower the target's Defense stat.""
maybe there's a sheer force user with choice band that can use crunch or an elemental fang move to rack up higher damage?

My grandpa took me to this event which is why it's important to me. I can remember they were distributing Pikachu dolls via helicopters and that at the end we got these shirts. 
I'm not sure if they were free or if my grandpa bought them but on them it was a few of the common pokemon, Snorlax, Charizard and Pikachu are the only ones I can remember for sure. They were in a cage and it said ""gotta catch 'em all"" at the bottom. My grandpa wore this shirt for years and it's because of him and that event that I love Pokemon the way I do.

Mawile's a great example of when plastic surgery goes too far. 
You meet this girl in college like ten years ago, and she's alright. Unassuming, shy, different, the only mono-steel type apart from Registeel and pfft, let's face it: That guy's a nazi-sympathizing prick. So you introduce yourself and hit it off.
You get along with Mawile pretty well because hey, she can Baton Pass a Swords Dance very nicely compared to most of Gen 3. It's a nice fling to have with a girl with such defensive typing prowess (Back then she even resisted Ghost types OMG). But in the end, you just don't see the fling going anywhere, you know? The lacking stats, the way she just looks back at you during battles... it all just makes you think that there's something better out there. Something that doesn't have the ability to chew steel with their demon jaws. Someone less... clingy. 
So in the end, you finish the relationship before it gets too deep and move on with your life. You try to let her down gently, remind her of how great her Intimidate ability is, and how you still value her absolutely fucking awesome lore. But you can tell it's still stinging her. You walk out of her apartment, and silently wish her the best for the future.
Fast forward ten years and BAM. Guess who you meet at a nightclub for the 30th birthday party of a mutual friend? That's right, Mawile, but now, things are different. Guess who married a lawyer and had a second mouth surgically attached to the back of her once beautiful head? That's right: this chick. Complete with mouths that remind you of Barney Gumble.
She hardly looks the same anymore; the shyness, the smirk, the mono-steel typing, all gone. And she STILL remembers you breaking up with her and she STILL wants to make you feel bad about it. So she goes around for the rest of the night flaunting her new Fairy typing, like you even give a crap anymore, and tries to make you feel weird when all you wanted to do was wish your friend Adam from Sales Reporting a ""happy birthday"" and head home for the night. 
Instead, you've got a poorly-aged Mawile screaming in your ""stupid one-mouth face"" every-so-often that she's ""too good for you"" and brags that she's ""so rich now"" that she's had to ""be moved to Uboors, whatever the hell that means"".
So yeah, thanks Mawile, for suddenly entering my life again and making it as weird as possible for a very brief amount of time.
Mawile, if you're out there, I hope you're happy, no matter how many weird jaw/head augmentations your new millionaire husband let's you have. We'll always have Sootopolis, always.

From there I just started my giveaway. Hope you enjoyed.

8516	"What would your life be like the world suddenly changed, and all the humans became... Pokemon?"	"29"	"32"	"20150706"	"estrellitadelmarIs a Cubone IRL"	"Oh no! Or perhaps... oh yay? Everyone in the world has suddenly turned into Pokemon! Your friends, your family, you, you're all Pokemon!

Which Pokemon did you become? Why?
Your level is based on your age and birth month! If you're 50 or younger, your age is the number you use. If you're over 50, count backwards. If you're 61, your number would be 39. Take this number and multiply it by 2. Subtract it by the month you were born. So for a 61 year old born in November, their level would be 67! (61-50 = 11. 50-11 = 39. 39*2 = 78. 78-11 = 67.) Alternatively, a 14 year old born in February would be level 26! (14*2 = 28. 28-2 = 26.) If your level would be less than 1 through this method, you're automatically level 1.
What Pokemon did your close friends and family become? Your roomates, if you have them? If you know their age and birth months, what levels are they?
You go to school / work / a movie, all the people are Pokemon, what's going on?
At some point someone starts a battle with you, what are your moves? Keep them to your Pokemon species! So no Caterpie with Fire Blast. The person who starts a fight with you can be random, or a friend, or a sibling. Who wins the fight?
What part of your life has changed the most since becoming a Pokemon?
You're still a Pokemon a month later. What changes have you gotten used to? What changes are driving you crazy?

Lately on reddit I've been seeing this debate on wether or not Game Freak should release more remakes. with ORAS out for a bit now and new games possibly on the horizon, it is a debate worth having. now the argument FOR a remake seems pretty logical: 'hey I played this game as a kid and had lots of great memories playing it and I want to play it again' and the argument against them seems just as standard. 'I played this story way too MUCH and don't want to see it again.' however in my mind there are two philosophies behind remakes. FR/LG seemed to be of the idea that it had to be EXACTLY the same. and I would agree that this would be pretty boring. however every remake since has added a significant amount of that 'new' factor, especially looking at ORAS on these new systems compared to the original gen 3 R/S/E, the technology allows for so many new features that it essentially FEELS like a sequel (and don't forget the delta episode!). coming from someone who invested maybe 2 or 3 hundred hours ( at least) of his childhood into R/S/E, I was amazed at how different the gen VI remakes were. I think new re-remakes of the much outdated FR/LG or maybe even sinnoh remakes really isn't as bad a thing as people make it out to be. What's your opinion? Share it with me below
TL;DR remakes of old games are a good thing IMO, as long as they include enough new features, new story elements like the delta episode, etc to improve on the original games

My first question is what is the relationship between Black and White? I remember hearing that they have different settings... Like one was forest and the other was city? Are the stories different too? Is it worth playing both if my only goal is to catch up on missed story or lore? 
My next question is what is the relationship between B/W and B2/W2? If I pick Black,  should I pick Black 2.
How worth it is Soul Silver if I played Silver as a kid? 
Thanks

I'm curious to see if anyone has found some cut content from XY/ORAS? I heard forever ago that someone may have found two cut moves for Zygarde that hinted at him maybe having alternate forms at some point, but nothing beyond that.

Since there was no Sleep clause some players also got affected by Spore spam, and in the end he won the tournament and making a very boring final.
There was various discussions of how to deal with the team, like Mist (the most effective one?), stealth rocks and spikes, or Hyper Voice/Infiltrator going through substitutes. But i wanna know if there's some basic strategy(es) against it which doesn't fully require an anti-baton build.

You won't get the max number of Pokeblocks, though; the number of Pokeblocks you get will be equal to the number of berries you use.
The game won't let you select ""Start blending!"" with the D-pad if you're using less than 4 berries (and when you are it automatically jumps to the button for you) so I thought this might be a detail some people have overlooked.
I'm really anal about having the same number of each type of berry, weird as that may sound, so this was handy for me to know, because it lets me pick off a couple of berries I ""don't need"" even if I don't have the full four for blending.

Announcements regarding new sticky thread cycle, self-post + spoilers and the winner of the giveaway!



Sticky Thread rotation
A while ago we posted a questionnaire to get feedback on /r/pokemon. We got a lot of responses, so we'd like to thank you all for that! Based on this questionnaire we'd like to introduce a new sticky thread rotation.
This rotation consists of three weeks in which on locked days specific threads will be stickied. What this means is that you can expect specific content to be a sticky thread once every three weeks. At any point, this sticky schedule could be interrupted for threads about news (think E3, new release trailers) or AMAs (we're gonna try to get more of those!), when this happens the schedule will be postponed to next week.
The new rotation will start next Monday and will also be placed in the sidebar so you know when they will go live. At the bottom of this post I will go more in-depth on what each sticky will be about and please keep in mind this is something we're testing out: feedback is much appreciated!
The new Sticky Thread rotation:
Week 1:
Monday: Noob questions
Friday: Feature discussion
Week 2:
Monday: Art thread
Friday: Promote thread
Week 3:
Monday: Rage thread
Friday: Feedback thread
Explanation of threads:
Noob questions:
Have question that needs answering? Think it is a noob question? No worries. In this thread you can ask all kinds of questions even if the answer is so obvious. Or... are you a newbie to the Pokemon franchise? Or... wanna find out stuff you might not know? This is the thread for you.
Feature discussion:
This thread will focus on specific features of the Pokemon franchise. We will start with content from ORAS (think DexNav, Secret Bases, etc) and XY (Mega Evolutions, breeding mechanics, Super Training, etc). So, have an interesting thought or found something noteworthy about these features? Check it out!
Art thread:
This thread will be focusing on Pokemon art and Pokemon art only. Every new thread will have a different theme (think doodles, cute Pokemon, Mega Pokemon, Fusions, etcetera). Found something sweet or made some cool content? This is the place to share it!
Promote thread:
In the promote thread we will place something or someone in the spotlights! Think interesting subreddits, awesome streamers, great Pokemon news sites, etcetera. In the comments you can also show your appreciation for other things: wanna show that you really like this streamer, or appreciate a guide someone made? This is the place.
Rage thread:
No Pokeballs when you saw that shiny? Lost a WiFi battle because your last Pokemon froze? Accidentally released that 6IV Pokemon? Just wanna vent out some frustration? Well, now you can, once every 3 weeks!
Feedback thread:
This thread is specifically there for us to get feedback from the community on /r/pokemon. We want to be more in-touch with you guys. So, feel something needs a change? Have a suggestion for our CSS or our rules? Got a cool idea or just wanna say you like something? Go ahead, we really appreciate it because we want to keep on improving this subreddit!



Self-post and spoilers
As of Friday the 5th, we're out of self-posts. ORAS has been released worldwide for more than a week. This means that only posts that go in-depth of the story / end-game of ORAS needs to be marked as spoilers. Any post about mega evolutions, secret bases, etc can be posted without a spoiler-tag.
If you're not sure if you should spoiler flair it, you can always contact the mods about it :)



Giveaway
Last Friday we started a giveaway of these awesome Kanto badges. The winner of this giveaway is...
-drumroll-
... /u/NobleCombatir! Congratulations! /u/KyozoKicks will contact you soon about your information so he can send them to you.
To all: thanks for competing and thanks for following us on Twitter. We will keep on posting news, top Reddit posts and other Pokemon related stuff regularly! So, keep an eye out for that :)



To conclude this post...
I'd like to highlight again that the new sticky rotation is something under construction. We think the current way would fit, but if it doesn't we will have to finetune and improve it. So, if you have any feedback (now, or in the future), please let us know :) We hope you guys like it and have fun because of it.

How the hell do you people do this? Do I suck? I decided at one point to turn off moveset randomization but that makes it so much less interesting and appealing... I managed to play through to the first gym once and I got into a double battle with 2 charmanders both with blast burn and drought...like, wtf am I supposde to do? ;(
Thanks :)

I'm posting because I am a few grinding hours away from facing the elite four with pokemon only aquired through wonder trades.  I also use the nuzlocke rules (where if a Pokemon faints, you can't use it anymore, and you can only catch one pokemon per route)  I've had a lot of ups and downs and feel I should share my team (and a few of those that didn't make it)

that's the team going in.  I got a bit lucky with some trades. (Especially honedge and a fennekin that was the second to last trade I made.)  I think after some training and some move deletion I'll be ok.
Fun facts about my journey so far 
First wonder trade I made I got a dratini.  I Was So Excited.  It died to Brawly's Makuhita.  I was crushed.  Two trades later I got another one! What luck! It died two battles later to a freaking Gloom What a crock.
I also had a Zorua that I loved.  I babied it the whole way to make sure it lived.  It got Magnitude 10'd for a critical hit by a geodude 6 levels below her.  I didn't play for 2 days.
A similar situation happened with a growlithe I received (a personal favorite) Literally the battle after I announced I wouldn't let the same thing happen to him as Zorua, critical Karate Chop.  2 more days of refusal to play.
This game taught me that Minun, Diggersby, and Kecleoon are actually pretty dang awesome.  (Kecleon is my emergency backup in case one of the lowbies dies in training.)
I actually got a game breaker via wonder trade.  A guy who goes by the twitter handle dpaddoc apparently gives out shiny lvl 100 pokemon with perfect evs and an insane moves each week.  I never heard of him until I traded with him (his twitter handle was his hello message) and somehow stumbled into the middle of his giveaway and received a shiny linoone with seed bomb, belly drum, extremespeed, and shadow claw, adamant, the whole nine.  I won't be using him (Even though, come ON that's awesome, right) unless each other pokemon I have dies and he's my last living pokemon in my box.  Just my luck to get so lucky I can't use it.
So that's it!  I'm off to level up and face Steven with all the hope in my heart.  I think I'll be fine.  Aegislash should be more than enough.  Ill post again if i make it.  Thanks for reading and wish me luck!

If you're interested in being a Challenger or a Leader then the full League Rules can be found here.
As always, please be mindful of the rules when visiting other subreddits. I'll look forward to seeing you on the battlefield.

What are the chances of the offspring having the hidden ability when bred with a Ditto? I've read some places saying that Ditto negates the 80% chance of passing down the HA when using a female parent with the HA however some say it makes no difference. My own experience left me even more confused. Whilst breeding for a HA Sableye (Ditto + Female Sableye w/ Prankster), barely any of the offspring had the HA, however when breeding HA Slowpokes (Ditto + Female Slowpoke w/ Regenerator), nearly all of the offspring had the HA. So, what are the actual chances?

With each new generation I think that it might be the last but then the people at Game Freak always surprise everyone with a new location and a whole bunch of new Pokemon to catch.  While they can of course keep going with remakes and new games in the current generation, I think of how they would bring the whole thing to a close (if ever).  I would personally like to see one more generation and a huge game at the end, one where you explore every region and truly have a chance to ""catch 'em all.""  But I would also like to hear what you all think they should and what you would like to see in the future.

It introduced a new region, a new way of capturing pokemon and introduced a new perspective to the series. It also introduced the first 4th generation pokemon to appear in a 3rd generation game, Manaphy. 
The part that I liked about the series the best is that capturing a pokemon isn't determined by luck, it has 100% to do with the player's skill and strategy. Learning the pattern of attacks, behavior, and type matchups for assists often made the difference between a successful capture and a broken styler. 
I believe that the ranger series is one of the few in the Pokemon franchise that has a true cinematic and gripping story. Although it became a little outlandish in Guardian Signs it was still and excellent storyline. 
If you haven't tried out the games for yourself I highly recommend it. When people ask me which one to get I tell them to start with Shadows of Almia.

Some have different forms, each with its own signature attack (Kyurem, Glaciate Kyrem Black: Freeze Shock, Kyurem White, Ice Burn, Hoopa Confined: Hyperspace Hole, Hoopa Unbound: Hyperspace Fury, etc.)
There are two unreleased Ground-type attacks, Thousand Arrows and Thousand Waves:

Thousand Arrows has 90 BP and 100% accuracy and can hit Flying-type Pokemon and those with Levitate
Thousand Waves also has 90 BP and 100% accuracy but simply traps foes and prevents them from fleeing.

Seems like pretty heavy evidence that out of the three Ground-type legendaries (Groudon, Landorus and Zygarde [not counting Earth Plate Arceus]) two already have had form changes, and one was already given a signature attack (Precipice Blades).
I doubt that Landorus is going to be featured any time soon, it makes sense that the new Pokemon that we've seen is a new form of Zygarde, to go along with new moves, and possibly only one of two that it can change in to, maybe to Y Zygarde and X Zygarde.

Anyways, the other day I had the urge to play some Pokemon, so I popped in my OR version. Apparently the last time I played I had saved at the outside entrance of my house in Littleroot Town. I decide to walk to the second town and get to the PC at the Pokemon Centre. Upon walking into the Pokemon centre I see Nurse Joy's PC screen has a birthday cake on it and the birthday Pokemon centre music was playing. The thing is, it wasn't my birthday. My birthday is in February, not July. Even talking to Nurse Joy she wishes me a Happy Birthday. I even went to my 3DS's settings and checked if I accidentally changed my birthday settings, and nope I didn't. I decided to turn off the game and return to it another time without saving. Today I opened the game again, and once again the game thinks it's my birthday. This is the case for every Pokemon centre in the game. Even after saving and reopening the game, the game still thinks it's my birthday. I don't mind the birthday music but it is kinda annoying if the game is permanently   going to be like this.

I do not speak any Japanese, however I am trying to learn some phrases in preparation for my trip. That being said, I will be a total tourist and would like to go check out this event! I would also like to go see the new Pokemon movie (I don't care that I won't be able to understand it) I enjoy watching foreign films with subtitles and I'm sure the plot won't be impossible to figure out. And maybe even the Pokemon center. The best day for me to do these things will be August 11th.
A little more about myself - I'm a 23 y/o, graduated university and have a full time job (I'm not a shady drifter, promise!) but if you would like to know more about me just send a message - I'd love to hear from you. I can ""probably"" manage these explorations by myself but it¡¦d be more fun to make new friend(s) in the process. 
Thanks!

They were offering up a Hoopa and I decided I'd trade them my shiny Cryogonal for it (not exactly the best deal but I thought I could get away with it) . I wasn't paying attention or something and they switched the pokemon to a Pumpkaboo at the last second and my shiny was sent off on it's way.
So at this point I start to think of ways I can ask them for it back. At first I just showed them their own pumpkaboo and thought they might catch my drift. Didn't work.  When I was trading with them I noticed they used a zigzagoon to ask if I had a Gardevoir, so I took a page out of their book and caught some pokemon and named them.  
First pokemon I caught and named was a Skorupi I titled ""PlsTradeBack""...a few tries with that and they were unresponsive, I was certain they had caught the memo at this point because they quickly flashed my shiny poke and hid it again. So I decided to guilt them. I caught three more Skorupi. The first one named ""NeedPokeBack"" the second named ""WasGiftFrom"" and the final...""DeadBrother"". Out of the kindness and hopefully pity in this strangers heart, they traded me back my pokemon. 
also my brother isn't dead. Am i an asshole for doing this ?
side note: someone, somewhere out there, just received a Skorupi named DeadBrother on Wonder Trade

To sign up to be a manager comment here.
To sign up to be a player comment here.
Spreadsheet
Hey guys, I¡¦m Num3r1cal, and I¡¦m looking to start a Pokemon League based on Nugget Bridge¡¦s NPA.  I couldn¡¦t find anything like it on reddit, so here we go.
The /r/redditvgcleague will be a team tournament held here on Reddit that lets players join together and work as a team to try to best the competition. All 12 teams play in 8 rounds with the top 4 in each division making playoffs. The last remaining team in the playoffs will become the champions for this season. All matches will be played with the VGC ruleset. Just a reminder the rules are:

All matches will be played on Pokemon Omega Ruby or Alpha Sapphire
Battles will be played in the doubles format
6 Pokemon on a team, 4 brought to battle.
Certain Pokemon are banned

There will be weekly coverage going on throughout this season, so even if you aren¡¦t drafted be sure to follow all of that!
Tournament Structure 

Each week, teams will go head to head in a fight to win the best of 5 games. So the winning team for the week will have to win 3 or more games. 
The 5 matches will consist of 5 VGC matches between each member of the team.
There are 8 weeks in the season, All-Star Break, two weeks for playoffs, and a week for finals for a total of 12 weeks
Each team will consist of the 1 manager and a minimum of 5 battlers. Each week, each manager must submit a roster of what 5 players they are using for the week to Num3r1cal. Managers are not allowed to play in the weekly games, but are encouraged to help the team practice.
Managers must post saying they¡¦re subbing an inactive player out to put in another player. Once a player is subbed in that week, they must either play or the match will be decided on activity.
All games will be played on Nintendo 3DS system using Pokemon Omega Ruby or Alpha Sapphire

Managers
For RVGCL to be a success, players must step up for the role of manager. Being a manager, you get to have fun organizing your team together and then working with the players to try to get them to play to the best of their ability as each week comes along. Here we have sign ups for you to apply and try to become a manager yourselves.
WE NEED MANAGERS, PLEASE APPLY HERE
If you have a crew made up, or you want to gather your own players, YOU MAY BRING YOUR OWN TEAM TO THE LEAGUE.  If you do this, you will not participate in the draft.
Draft
Players will have a chance to sign up until July 31st, and the draft will be held in a thread in /r/redditvgcleague. The draft his will be a snake format (1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 3, 2, 1, 1, 2, 3, etc.) (if you have questions about it, just comment below). As a manager¡¦s turn comes around, they will have 6 hours to make their pick, or they lose their pick for that round.  It¡¦s recommended that a manager come into the draft with a set of players already in mind to draft.
Details of the draft will be worked out soon.
Trades
If teams wish, they may trade for players from other teams for players of their own. They will first start out by proposing the trade to the team manager they want to deal with. If both managers agree to the trade, message the trade info to Num3r1cal using the reddit¡¦s message system. Once you receive approval, the trade is official and considered done. If a trade is done mid-week, the player swap is in effect at the end of the week.
No more trades may be made after week 6.
Mid-Season and All-Star Week
There will be a mid-season break after week 4 for teams to pick up new players in the mid-season draft and conduct trades. While this is going on, the current 10 players with the best ratings will be able to participate in All-Star Week.
Playoffs
The playoffs will contain the top 2 teams from each division. It will be single elimination.
Rankings
Rankings will be determined by the Iteritive Strength Rating System(ISR).  It is basically ratings that factor in Strength of Schedule.

I think these would be cool because there isn't a fire/fairy yet, and it would counter steel types well, while also providing good dragon coverage that a lot of fire types lack. We have Water/Dragon in Kingdra, but I'd like to see something else as this typing is really strong with only 2 weaknesses. It also pits well against the Fire/Fairy typing because both would have moves to check each other. I like Grass/Electric too because we only see it on a Rotom form so I feel like it could be fleshed out well. Only 3 weaknesses as well with Ground and Flying being offset.

This survey asks which Pokemon you guys think would best suit these roles in this hypothetical Pokedex of at least 150 Pokemon. Next week, when I show you guys the results, we can start discussing what a game with this Dex would be like.
The survey link is here. I made it so you aren't required to answer any of the questions to avoid people answering a question without thinking for the sake of getting it over with. I also made a box for you guys to put in more Pokemon than the ones I listed, because the ones I listed obviously aren't enough to fill a Dex.
Please upvote this for visibility. Remember, I can't even get karma for text posts. I want this to have an accurate representation of the sub's opinions, and that can't happen without people seeing it!
If you have ideas for Pokemon groupings other than the ones I posted (bird Pokemon, Fossils, etc.), tell me in the comments.
Thanks for your help with this!
UPDATE:

If you're reading this, you've been in a coma for almost 20 years now, we're trying a new technique. We don't know where this message will end up in your dream, but we hope we're getting through. Please wake up! We miss you.

It's okay, I'm awake. I ran into a wall a couple times to be sure.
UPDATE 2:
I updated the form with new things. Sorry for any confusion while I was updating it :P
Remember, don't vote for a Pokemon twice! If you see a Pokemon in two categories, don't vote for it in both! That discourages diversity, and we want diversity.
UPDATE 3: Once we hit 250 responses I'll make a rough sketch of the Dex and tell you what it'll roughly look like without giving away what actually happened.
UPDATE 4: We hit 250! I've counted 300 Pokemon in the Dex so far. That includes the most voted for Pokemon, as well as the ones from the suggestion box that more than one person repeated. It's pretty diverse. I haven't laid them all out yet so I don't know the typing spread, but I'm sure with 300 you can't go that repetitive.
UPDATE 5: Looking at the responses right now. I feel bad for those Pokemon who are surrounded in their categories by other Pokemon with like 100 votes, while they only have like 1.
UPDATE 6: Please don't resubmit all your votes just to answer one more question. Just answer the new question separately, or your other votes will be counted twice. Gonna start deleting duplicates like these that have the same exact answers but one more question answered.
UPDATE 6: HOLY CRAP WE REACHED 500 OVERNIGHT! I added another question and might add more later on. Hopefully this will give the Dex a little more variety.
UPDATE 7: I forgot Genesect! Sorry Genesect!
UPD8: I'll get the results to you tomorrow around noon EST.
UPDATE 9: There are currently 166 Pokemon in the Pokedex using the current results, but only using the multiple choice answers so far.
UPDATE 10: Results are coming to a new post within half an hour!

8700	"Pokemon X/Y Nuzlocke Variety Rule"	"6"	"10"	"20150727"	"jengelke*****"	"So, I am going to be starting a Nuzlocke run with a new copy of Pokemon Y and a problem I noticed in other runs (watching, etc.) is a lack of variety to include the new gen mons (since they are smaller in number than other generations). I would like /r/pokemon's advice/opinion of a simple rule that could enhance the chances of making a generationaly diverse run.
Something like every X Pokemon must be a 6th Gen mon if one has not been caught yet. Basically, I just want to augment the standard Nuzlocke rules so that in certain circumstances, a new gen mon must be caught.
What do you guys think?
If anyone is curious, these are the rules I plan to use:
Standard Rules

Faint = Dead > Release
Catch only 1st Pokemon in each area; limited to it's use (faint or flee and cannot catch in that area)
Nickname All Caught

Additional Rules

No healing items during battle; held berries are ok
No purchasing healing items
No Gift/Story/Legendary Pokemon (fossils, etc)
No Duplicate/Evolutionary Line Duplicates; 1st catch rule suspended
Battle Style = Set
No Exp Share
No Battle Training
Shiny Clause: Can catch any Shiny and box it; alternatively, can use in party if it meets the requirements of the run

?
Edit: So, I think I might have a clarification to the rule that might work out well. Thanks to everyone for helping focus the idea. Also adding optional rule that supports the idea as well.

New Gen Clause: If no Pokemon from the current Generation have been caught by the time you reach the first Pokemon Gym, the next 2 captures must be Pokemon from the new Gen; all others are ignored in regards to capture rules.
Optional Rule: Party must always contain at least 1 monster from the current Generation. If the party is ever lacking this, the trainer must ignore older Gen monsters in new areas until a current Gen monster has been captured. This rule is ignored if it is no longer possible to obtain a new Gen Pokemon.

The gist of it is, a pokemon's genetics would be cryptographically signed by gamefreak's servers, and pokemon would have to be ""downloaded.""
So right after purchasing the game and booting it up, you'd have to activate it, which would require an internet connection. This would associate your game ID with your console ID on gamefreak's servers, and an ""initial batch"" of pokemon to populate your world would be generated on gamefreak's server, and then cryptographically signed. Each pokemon would be associated with an area where you could catch it in game (the ""caught in"" portion of its genetics), and of course a greater number of more common pokemon would be generated, a lesser number of rarer pokemon would be generated, and only one of each legendary would be generated. All these pokemon are then downloaded and stored locally. If your save data gets wiped you can download the ""initial batch"" again, but you wouldn't be able to cause a new ""initial batch"" to be generated without purchasing a new copy of the game.
This would mean it would be possible to hunt a certain pokemon to ""extinction."" So if 20 dratinis were generated and you caught them all, then it wouldn't be possible to find any other dratini in your game. You would wipe your save, and try again but the 20 dratini you caught would be genetically identical to the 20 dratini. This also means that if you caught zapdos, then reset, then caught zapdos again, both zapdos would be genetically identical.
But is that it? That would suck catching 20 dratini and having them all be sucky! Well there's a few ways you can get more pokemon released into your game.
Trading
Of course you can trade for pokemon. A trade would go through gamefreak's servers, and would involve modifying the current owner and the pokemon ID in the pokemon's genetics and resigning each pokemon. Of course through shenanigans it's possible for the pre traded copy to remain (copy a save, trade, load the old save). However the trading process would flag the ""old pokemon"" (which shouldn't even exist) as unable to be re downloded or legitimately used in online play. So basically before the trade:

Anna's Bulbasaur, originally owned by Anna, ID #1111 [Legit]
Beth's Charmander, originally owned by Beth, ID #2222 [Legit]

After trade:

Anna's Bulbasaur originally owned by Anna, ID #1111. [Deleted from Anna's save, can't be redownloaded or used in online battles].
Anna's Charmander, originally owned by Beth, ID #1112. [Legit]
Beth's Charmander, originally owned by Beth, ID #2222. [Deleted from Beth's save, can't be redownloaded or used in online battles.]
Beth's Bulbasaur, originally owned by Anna, ID #2221. [Legit]

Breeding
To not be exploitable this would have to be pretty radically different. For now we're just going to pretend it doesn't exist so we don't get sidetracked.
Cloning
Jk this is NOT possible. If the game ID in a pokemon's genetics doesn't match your game ID then fugetaboutit. If two pokemon exist in the same game with the same ID then they're donezo.
Online battles
Winning online battles would cause additional pokemon to be released into your world. Winning online battles against higher elo opponents would cause more/rarer pokemon to be released.
Spotpass
Additional pokemon could be released into your world via spotpass, as part of timed events, or randomly, or who knows.
Streetpass
Some of the pokemon generated during the inital batch, would be marked as streetpass pokemon. You can't catch these pokemon in your game period, however if you streetpass someone you'll receive some of their streetpass pokemon in your tall grass. I know this is kind of silly but I also know that nintendo really wants to make streetpass a thing for some reason...
DLC
Yes I went there. This could be really baltent in the manner of ""for $ release a bunch of rare pokemon of a particular type to certain areas so they're easy to find and you can catch some good ones."" However it can also be less blatant, such as ""for $$$ unlock a new area where you can fight and catch all the legendaries again."" This could potentially be HUGE money for gamefreak.
Microtransactions
A certain number of gemstones come with your game (which increases the net amount over time). Your actual balance is stored online though of course, not in your save file. People could offer their pokemon up on the public market, with a price in gemstones, which allows you to spend and earn gemstones (while keeping the net amount the same). Gemstones can be used to obtain additional rare random pokemon in your tall grass (which decreases the net amount of gemstones). Finally of course, gemstones can be purchased in bulk using $$$.

As for hacking this. One thing you could do is you could do is read all the pokemon that populate your world from your save file, figure out which pokemon in your world are of interest to you, then using save file editing or memory shenanigans to instantly catch those pokemon without having to play through the game. This obviously puts you at an advantage, but it wouldn't allow you to obtain a perfect shiny jirachi. What it will get you instead is a near perfect zubat you would probably have missed under normal circumstances, without having to play the game.
As for piracy, obviously a pirated game couldn't download any pokemon from gamefreak, or generate any pokemon themselves. So the pirate would have to change the ROM to insert their own public key certs, then they could play god and generate their own pokemon (as either part of the hacked rom, or downloaded from pirate servers). However pokemon generated with pirate certificates will look like cryptographic garbage to people with legitimate copies of the game.
So what do you think? One of my main goals with this proposal was to have a game that functioned perfectly normally offline, while having rewards for online play, in contrast to a always online system (because no one wants to not be able to play pokemon because the servers are down). The only REQUIRED connection is immediately after booting the game for the first time, to ""activate"" it. It might even be possible to remove this step by having the initial batch pre loaded on to a cartridge, or downloaded as part of the web store game download.

EDIT: Implementing a system like this would allow an official ranked online ladder to exist. This would be the core of the endgame, and what people would spend their time doing long after AI trainers had been bested. The other endgame stuff, such as capturing new pokemon and trading, would be done mainly with the goal of improving your ladder team. As I mentioned winning ladder battles would populate your world further, so someone participating in the ""proper endgame"" would always have new pokemon out in the wild waiting to be discovered. After all the main goal was always to be the very best, like no one ever was.

1) You wonder trade your starter away in the beginning and whatever Pokemon you get back is the type you have
2) If you get a dual typing, you can choose which type you want
3) Catch the first Pokemon you see on every route (like a normal nuzlocke) but if they do not fit your typing, wonder trade until you get a matching type
4) Nickname all Pokemon you catch
5) if a Pokemon faints, it must be released or boxed permanently. 
If you guys have any ideas to improve this, let me know! I'm going to probably try this out soon, so I can give updates on how well it works too if you want

It needs to be based around an entry fee of 10 to 15 dollars, so keep that in mind.
I was stumped about what I could do, and I would really like my VG tournament goers to have a blast, but I also don't want to just hand out money to the winners of each VG tournament, unless that's really the only viable thing. 
Unfortunately, The Pokemon Company is very disorganized, and I have yet to be sanctioned, as they have lost my background check, and now the link for the form is dead. So prize support on their side is going to have to wait.
I really want to give my players an experience so any ideas would be more than welcome!

I've been a bit reluctant to post about something that may seem silly, but it seems that this community has been friendly to posts like this in the past, so hopefully you guys won't mind. I'm looking for a long lost Pokemon game of mine, and I can't really think of any way to find it aside from seeing if someone here has come across it.
For a bit of background, I may seem a bit ranty... so feel free to skip to the TL;DR (with the most relevant information) if you want from here. I'll just be explaining why I'm posting now about a 2-year-missing game.
I let my nephews play a lot of my old games from my childhood. Usually, though I hung on to my copy of Pokemon Stadium 2 since it was sentimental to me. I had clones of my old Pokemon since 1998 in there for safe keeping, and I'd always keep it in my room. Although I also had them on my Gold save file, I felt like backing them up was necessary.
However, I had no N64 as my nephews had inherited it from me. At some point I just decided to bring it over and let them play it, trying to introduce them to games I liked when I was a kid. Around that time I got whisked away to a new job, and it was hard to visit from then on. While I was off at that new job, my save battery for my Gold version died, and I wasn't aware that the lifespan of it was so finite. I thought ""no worries, I can simply get my lost Pokemon off of the backup clones I had in Stadium 2.""
Upon returning to my sister's house, I made it a point to pick it up, but I soon discovered it had been sold (along with every other old game I had allowed my nephews to play) on eBay. Apparently these games were old and not fun anymore to them, so they thought they'd make some money of it. I was upset for many reasons, but the financial loss did not bother me all that much. I could buy old games again, and I have made an effort to, but nothing can replace the years of love I put into my old Pokemon back in 1998.
What's worse is that they claimed to have never sold/seen this copy Stadium 2 in the house, so I had fragments of hope that it wasn't actually gone. Frantic searching led to no results though. After about 2 years of wondering where it could have been misplaced, I asked my sister to check her eBay history. Apparently she sold it there (and forgot she had even done so), and had records of the person she sold it to.
I felt really uncomfortable contacting them and asking to buy it back, but I felt like a piece of my childhood was stripped away from me, and I was hoping he might understand and let me buy it back. Much to my dismay, the person she bought it from turned out to be a retro game re-seller. He bought it simply to resell it in his store in Logan, Utah (roughly across the whole country for me), and it was long gone to some random buyer by this point.
I know this is a complete shot in the dark, but if you're around the Logan, Utah area and recently got a copy of Stadium 2 since the second half of 2013, maybe you've come across it? It's likely the game might be wiped by now, but if someone out there has it, and it still has my old Pokemon, I'd pay more than a fair price to have it back. It's the one piece of my childhood I wanted to keep forever.
TL;DR : My old copy of Pokemon Stadium 2 was sold at a retailer in Logan, Utah around (or after) September, 2013, and it has my old Pokemon on it. If you happen to have it (by some miracle), I'd be willing to buy it back at a more-than-fair price (and even provide a replacement cartridge).
My cartridge should have at least these Pokemon in the N64 boxes: ...

""SQUIRT"" the Feraligatr
""GEETS"" the Ho-Oh
""GAATS"" the Lugia
""YUNNA"" the Umbreon (the last 3 were based off Megaman Legends 2 characters... I know I mispelled their names.)
""SUNUSER"" the Espeon (shh... I know it's dumb. I was young at the time of making these silly nicknames)

The original trainers of them were most likely ""Daniel""... some old Yellow/Blue pokemon probably had ""DANIEL"" as an original trainer. I know the Yellow/Blue trainer has the ID of 59084(Blue) and 26201(Yellow). There might also be a Blastoise by the name of ""YERTLE"" with the original trainer ""EJ""... as well as various other things I could check to verify the cartridge, but at this point it should be obvious if you have my old one or not.
Thank you to anyone who has gone through the trouble to read all of this. I feel a bit selfish in a way for making this kind of request to a community I haven't posted in very much. I also know there's extremely little chance I'll ever find my game again (and even if I did, it could be wiped clean save-wise). Once I make this post, I'll be doing my best to let it go. It would have just been eating at me if I hadn't at least tried to ask the internet for help. I can now say ""well, at least I tried!"" Thank you very much for your time. It helped me get a lot off my chest to at least write out all of these thoughts.
Feel free to comment with any memories you've had with your old Pokemon as well... I feel strange making a post so centered about myself, so I'd like to extend the discussion here to others' old Pokemon memories if anyone would like to chat about it. Also, share what silly names you nicknamed your Pokemon when you were younger, so I won't feel like such a nerd. :x

8730	"Question: Regional Leagues?"	"0"	"2"	"20150518"	"diosimNovice"	"Chatting with some friends and I was wondering if there were irl leagues/gyms
Essentially there'd be 3 levels:
International
National
State
Basically each state has 8 State Gym Leaders(SGL)
Then there would be 8 National Gym Leaders (NGL)
And lastly the International Final Four  Trainers(FFT) with a Final World Leader(FWL)
Each of the Gym Leaders would have 4-8 preliminary trainers of their choosing.
All participants would register for the league.
There would be weekly(?) tournaments at the state level where the gym leader could be challenged in their home town for a badge
The requirement would be that the gym leader's preliminary trainers where all beaten prior to the Challenging the State Gym Leader
With 8 State Badges in hand participants could then compete at the National Level.
Once a month(?) there would be an event where the National Gym Leader could be challenged. Again, which the defeat of their preliminary trainers. This earns players 8 National Badges
With national Badges the Final four can be challenged. I'm thinking at this point the challenge could be made at any time and some kind of schedule would need to be setup. (We battle at DAWN!)
And of course with the Blessings of the final 4 (Another token) the World leader could be challenged.
Some potential revisions I see would be to have a yearly event where the final 4-5 could be challenged
An example of an event could be at a high-school gym or toys-r-us
Walk in, register, hang out and mingle with other trainers when your number is called you can challenge a Preliminary trainer
One loss and you're out of the event for that day. each win would be recorded and you'd get some kind of token.
once you've got all of the tokens you'll get to challenge the Gym Leader.
If you lose you would either give up your tokens or maybe lose half of em so that you might not have to wait in line so long next time?
The National level ones would probably have more preliminary trainers.
The idea would be that you might wait 10-30minutes per battle and during the off time you could chat with other players.
Local Card shops could setup booths, tables and chairs would be provided for on the spot TCG and wireless battles.
The Online Artist community could be involved in the creation/design of badges for the events
A few notes:
Battles would be 2 double battles much like the official format.
Gym's would have themes based on types or concepts
Possibly this would extend to combat restrictions such as no supper effective's could be used. 
- ex: steel gym : hell no fire types to be used
Gym leaders could select their preliminary trainers, or a regular tournament could be held
Leaders at all levels would be selected via tournament. 
That's about all I got for now, I might return and revise later.

I know it's a long shot and I hope I'm not the only one who remembers this, but I was wondering if someone out there might still have these recipes or a link to where I can find them.

Are they any dual types that haven't being don't that you would like to see? Also, are there any pokemon you think should be dual type that aren't?
How would you feel about them changing the way dual type damage was calculated? For example, a Grass Poison type would take double damage from fire attacks (super effective), while a Poison Grass type would take 1.5 times (very effective). Also, a Bug Grass type would take half damage (not very effective) from Ground attacks, while a Grass Bug would take 75% (somewhat effective). And Ineffective moves would be half damage if the type was second slot, so a Psychic attack would do half damage on a Dragon Dark type.
Alternatively, how about three type pokemon, where the third type calculates damage at 1.5x for super effective attacks and 75% for not very effective attacks?

What did I lose exactly? Well, I got my first pokemon a few weeks after Pokemon Red and Blue was released, and ever since that time I have been collecting and transferring over my mons to the next gen(from gen 3 onwards). Naturally I had collected a ton of pokemon(every single one) from this, including event, special(strange move mons for example), shinies, legendaries and a ton of IV trained battle ready ones. 
This struck me extremely hard as I am an avid Pokemon fan. I mean, I have been living with this since I was a little kid. Kind of like a part of me. Just losing it all completely random, with no warning, feels like someone just chopped of a leg or something.
How would any of you react if something like this happened? And what would you do? Just start over? Give up? I am really torn, might just stop playing any other Pokemon games out of sheer spite and hate...
Anyway, Rant over, I just feel that I have to share this some someone that can sympathise and realise the loss I just had. I told a friend that isn't a gamer and he just laughed at me. q_q

I'm currently grinding my Marril as I just caught it so that's why its level is so low. Are there any additions or moveset swaps I could do with this line up? What should I add to this team?

I'm getting a tattoo for my first son (9 months old :D) and what I have in mind I don't feel my art skills can accurately purtray. So I am hoping one of are bored enough to give me something I can so my tattoo artist to give him an idea.
What I want is his name ""Liam"" in the pokemon logo style font (the blue and yellow) and the original three starters looking cute and what not. 
I would really appreciate this, thank you for taking the time to read and if their are any other questions needed I'll try to respond asap.
Edit: I have been asked before ""why pokemon for your sons tattoo?"" The reason is simple, pokemon took up a giant part of my child hood. From playing pokemon red and gold (my first two games) to playing the card game and browsing ebay begging my dad to buy me a charizard (which I still have with a select few). To playing pretend in the woods behibd my house  with my best friend who always chose squirtle, (charmander for the win!!) To this day I still play the games love omega ruby and y. My son is the greatest thing ever to me. And I want him to be tied in to the greatest memory's of my child hood!

This week's Pokemon is Gallade!

#475 Gallade (Japanese ????? Erureido)
The Blade Pokemon
Because it can sense what its foe is thinking, its attacks burst out first, fast, and fierce.

#282 Gardevoir (Japanese ????? Sirnight)

#281 Kirlia (Japanese ???? Kirlia)
The Emotion Pokemon
It is said that a Kirlia that is exposed to the positive emotions of its Trainer grows beautiful. This Pokemon controls psychokinetic powers with its highly developed brain.

#280 Ralts (Japanese ???? Ralts)
The Feeling Pokemon
Ralts senses the emotions of people using the horns on its head. This Pokemon rarely appears before people. But when it does, it draws closer if it senses that the person has a positive disposition.

Should I pick up the Official Strategy Guide as well, or does the game play okay on its own for newbie players?
The reviews on Amazon seem to be pretty scathing, but I dunno if that's a general consensus or just a disgruntled group of fans.

I have a question regarding digitally purchased pokemon games and sd cards. So, what i am wondering is if i will be able to download the same digitally purchased pokemon game (ORAS or XY) to 2 different sd cards, and if i can will it mess up with my save files if i try to play with the both sd cards in turn.
For example, (not so much an example actually, this is the situation) i have bought a Pokemon Y game and had a nice progress over Pokedex considering the free time i have to play it, and this month i have bought Pokemon Omega Ruby and I could not downloaded it to the 4gb SD Card which contains my Pokemon Y game. I have been keeping an extra SD Card with 8gb space so i have downloaded the Omega Ruby to the bigger Card. I am asking if i download the Pokemon Y game to the bigger SD Card,too -in order for me to stop changing SD Cards always-, will it mess with my progress on the old SD Card? And for more information, i use Pokebank and the system is 3DS XL.

I decided to place my reservation with Gamestop, who promised me I could get it the day of, if I picked it up in person. So I initially did that, and when the day came, there was a HUGE line for X and Y, and I was stuck in line for a good few hours. I'd like to avoid that this time, so I wanted to hear how you all intend to obtain your copy?
As I see it there are 3 main sources
Amazon
- Simple but not guaranteed day of delivery  
Gamestop or other game store
-In person pick up, guaranteed, but long and complicated.
-Delivery, more likely to get day of release, but more shipping costs. Seriously it's like at least $7 for shipping, that's ridiculous. 
Download
-Its possible to download the game, avoid the lines, the hassle, and the delivery, but I've always liked collecting the physical copies of the games, as I've done for every game in the series so far. Plus this takes up 3ds harddrive space
What does /r/pokemon plan to do? What arguments can you make to convince me of one way over another?

I saw there are a lot of hacks all around the web but i simply don't know how to choose one. I would like something a bit less rigid than the 1st generation. Some of the new features seems very fun.

However, being the busy person I am, I can't afford the time to breed and raise a Pokemon, let alone six! To make things worse, I have several personal rules that I refuse to break:

Never fleeing. This makes horde battles as a training method hard, if not impossible, since not fleeing means that my Pokemon may get unwanted EVs.
Never inbreeding. For the record, I once bred a 6 IV Greninja with Timid nature and Protean, never repeating any member of a couple. It took me roughly six boxes of Pokemon and around two weeks of hatching, though.
Never using O-Powers on myself. I think it's cheap to do so.

Also, since I'm passing several other games, my time to play is severely limited. I'd waste the Pokerus, since that one lasts only until midnight, and farming the Power items would take me years. What else can I do to use my playing time better?

Behind the turmoil, an evil team pulls the strings. Scientists recently developed a compound known as Beta X. Beta X is a Pokemon modifying chemical that completely nullifies the Pokemons' ability to think for itself, thus making it completely submissive and controllable.

8864	"Am I the only traditionalist when it comes to making a team?"	"0"	"8"	"20150817"	"Vealophile"	"So I've played Pokemon since GB Red and Blue way back when.  I've seen the advancement over time of the series (sans the Sapphire generation) and still to this day I always find that no matter how my base team changes its roster over the years (I usually put 1 new pokemon on my base 6 each generation) I just always play as if I were a trainer in the actual pokemon world.  By this I mean I never put legendaries on my team  as if I were a real trainer I would never have actually encountered more than 1 in my journey let alone capture one. (Yes in-game I capture them but I don't use them).  Now with the advent of megas I still just kind of eye-roll it.  By just chance my base team has no Pokemon on it that can mega anyway but I wouldn't be picking a new member of my team based on the fact that it can go mega and I most likely wouldn't even use the transformation in battle.  
I just want to be a simple trainer with a simple Pokemon team trained to be the best the can be without any special flair or gimmicks.  I'm just curious if there are any other trainers out there that do this too?

I am here to talk you about a project for the Pokemon strategy : the Draft Pokemon.
The Draft Pokemon has been inspired by the ""Draft mode"" from most of the greatest e-sports games.
It consists to ban Pokemon that can counter enemy's strategy and pick intelligently Pokemon you need on your team (a Pokemon can't be pick by both players).
Here's a little schema : http://i.imgur.com/g8Gd5Q0.png
First, to play it on console, you need at least 18 Pokemon (it's better if they are trained for battles), because 3 bans + 3 bans + 6 Pokemon pick by your opponent = 12 Pokemon that you can't play, your team has 6 Pokemon, so you must have 18 Pokemon in the extreme case.
You have to decide who will ban the first. The first player bans a Pokemon, the other player bans an other Pokemon, the first player bans a second Pokemon, etc. Both players ban 3 Pokemon.
BAN SCHEMA :
Player 1 : 1, 3, 5
Player 2 : 2, 4, 6
When the Pokemon are banned, the pick phase starts.
The player who ban first picks a Pokemon first (he can't pick a banned Pokemon), the other player then pick 3 Pokemon (he can't pick a banned Pokemon AND a picked Pokemon), the first player picks 3 Pokemon, the other player picks 2 Pokemon, the first player picks his finals 2 Pokemon and the other player picks his final Pokemon.
Note : Pokemon with forms (like genies, Megas, etc.) count as 1 Pokemon (for exemple : Landorus Incarnate and Landorus Therian is the same Pokemon, so a player can't pick a form if the other is already picked by the other player).
PICK SCHEMA :
Player 1 : 1, 4, 5, 6, 10, 11
Player 2 : 2, 3, 7, 8, 9, 12
And then, both players have their teams. They now can start to build their own teams with Pokemon they picked.
If you chose a specific tier, the original banlist is applied.
The Draft Pokemon is a project for the moment, but if a lot of people likes this idea (and of course you can say here what you want to edit/more), something will be programmed to automate the Draft Pokemon.
Thank you.

Here we go;
I know these two pokemon aren¡¦t from the same generation, but there¡¦s a striking similarity between Lopunny and Diggersby.
Both are rabbits and both have natural colouration. You know what they remind me of, if placed side by side? 
The classic ¡¥fat husband / beautiful wife¡¦ sitcom trope.
It¡¦s a million times more likely that this is where at least some inspiration for these two pokemon came from, because both have a design that could make them a related species, and they are also both in the Field egg group (with Lopunny also being in the Human-Like group). There was also some pretty solid proof that at least some pokemon designs may be planned in advance, and if that's true it wouldn't be surprising that at least a concept of Diggersby already existed when Lopunny was released.
The other theory isn¡¦t mine, I¡¦ve found it in serebii forums, but it also seems more likely, especially as we¡¦re talking about Japan;
Lopunny is simply based on Sailor Moon.
Sailor Moon¡¦s name is Usagi, which means rabbit.
What is Usagi well know for? For being hella clumsy - I haven¡¦t ever watched the show and even I know that.
What is Lopunny¡¦s Ability called? Klutz.
As for my preferred mega Lopunny?
Come on, she is so obviously based on Cammy from Street Fighter!

This is a story about a little boy (Spoiler: It's me) who loved Pokemon as a kid. I always played on GB until Ruby/Saphire, but than I became kinda old and really lame and stopped playing, because I didn't own a nintendo and I thought to myself ""Ohh, your too old for it anyway"". Now I know that I was wrong. 
By now I'm a 21 years old guy, studying in Cologne and living a nice and peacefull life. Peacefull? Well, if it was not for him! HE is a 19 years old guy which happens to be my best friend but who is als my arch nemesis. We are both terrible at loosing and both love bullying the other whenever we succeed over him (starts with Chess, ends with Rock-Paper-Scissors). 
Well and this guy decidet to challenge me to a Pokemon Duell. We both get a new version of ORAS and start at the same time, whenever we have time to battle and are about equally advanced in the storyline we fight and whoever looses will be punished by knowing that he failed. 
This leads me to my question: What would be a good team to go with? I havn't played since Ruby and don't know what could be op. Is their anything really strong that you guys can recommend me? I always liked Spore + Leech seed and stuff like this. I do know that IV training exists, but I don't know how to do it. Is it neccessary? I'm happy for anything that you guys can give me that might give me an edge. 
I MUST NOT LOOOOOSE!!!!!

Bolster Mark - ""A mark to be held by a Pokemon. It makes the wearer more resilient and forceful in battle.""
In the damage formula, there is a part where the damage is multiplied by a number between 0.85 and 1.00 at random (or 0 to 255 with a constant added onto it) that accounts for the variance in damage done. 

If a Pokemon is holding this item and uses a move that employs the damage formula, the variance number will be a number between 1.00 and 1.15 instead. 
If a Pokemon is holding this item and is hit by a move that employs the damage formula, the variance number will be 0.70 to 0.85 instead. 
If two Pokemon are holding Bolster Marks and one of them hits the other, the two items ""cancel out.""


Vault Brooch - ""The wearer of this brooch will have the effects of certain moves be realized before they occur.""

If a Pokemon holding this item successfully connects with a move that has a mandatory primary effect after the move is executed, the effect will instead happen before the move is executed.

I'll let you think about the usefulness of this item yourselves.

Viscosity Room
Type: Bug / Power: -- / Accuracy: -- / PP: 5 / Category: Status / Priority: 0 / Target: Field / Contact: No
""The user makes the air of the battlefield highly viscous for five turns, which lowers the amount that stats are changed by.""

Normally, stat changes are based on a 2/2 constant. Every one-stage increase increases the numerator by 1, and every one-stage decrease increases the denominator by 1.
While Viscosity Room is active, stat changes are instead based on a 5/5 constant, but the numerator and denominator rules stay the same.
Unlike Simple, this doesn't actually change the number of stages the stats are boosted or lowered by, just the amount of a stat that a stage increases or decreases.
Like Trick Room and friends, two uses of this move cancel each other out.

8901	"What do you think of these balance ideas?"	"5"	"21"	"20150831"	"Homem_da_Carrinha"	"First of all, my sincere apologies if stuff like this has already been pitched. I'm not a regular around here.
Second, again, really sorry if these ideas turn out to be really dumb.
With that out of the way...

Balancing Knock Off: it keeps the 65 base power, but knocked off items return upon switching. As far as I see it, it still remains a force to be reconned with because it can force a switch, which, coupled with good game-sense, can win games. As it is right now, it's way too useful, and promotes risky plays, since you can basically sacrifice a Pokemon of your party to permanently cripple your opponent's, and still come up on top.
Balancing Truant: We all know Truant is a terrible skill, and it's supposed to be, because Slaking by itself is Uber material. Thing is, just because it kinda makes sense, it doesn't really mean it's all that fun. Which is not. And can be easily handled by Protecting. Yes. A Pokemon with 160 base Attack can be beaten by anything with access to any combination out of Protect, Toxic and blocking switches. So, how about if it was changed so that, every other turn, Slaking either gets a massive offensive stat drop, or is rendered unable to use damage dealing moves?
Balancing Slow Start: Again, another skill that renders an otherwise behemoth of a Pokemon pratically unusable. Seriously guys, five turns is way too much. How about instead it gradually gets his stats back? Like each turn it gets a small increase in Attack and Speed, so that after five turns his force is completely restored? 
A Status Move That Inflicts Freeze: You get the picture. A move akin to Thunder-Wave or Will-o-Wisp, designed to specifically cause the enemy to freeze. Of course, freeze is somewhat tricky to work around because, unlike Sleep, it does not exactly last for a maximum number of turns. Each turn, the opponent has a one-in-five chance to thaw out, including the turn it got frozen. So, how do we balance this thing? By making the user take self-inflicted damage everytime it uses it, akin to Substitute, but maybe not as much health. The specific amount would be up for debate. And hence, Breath of Life. Now, for specific notes:
     1) it does not work on Ice-type Pokemon

     2) it does not work on any Pokemon whose skill specifically unables it.

     3) Shed Skin and similar skills will work on the freezing.

     4) Any move that a Pokemon can still perform while frozen will work here (keep in mind Scald is one of the most common-place moves nowadays).

     5) it will fail if Sunny Day or Drought is active.

     6) it will last at least one turn, not including the turn where it is used, unless 3 is applicable

     7) Now for the tricky part: it will replace any status condition the opponent already has, and upon thawing out, the opponent will be cured of the original condition.

     8) If it is used on an already frozen Pokemon it will not ensure continuation of the condition. Instead, it will fail, but the user will still deal damage to itself.


So that's about it. What do you guys think?

I had never seen anything so identical to Digimon within the Pokemon universe, even the name is the same (in Japan it is called Warp and in the US is called Mega), but the features and even some formats are similar. 
?
1 - The Mega evolving Pokemon is a temporary one, your monster will return to normal after a while. The same goes with Digimon.
?
2 - The Pokemon will return to normal after spending all energy. The same with Digimon.
?
3 - The Mega evolution is rare to happen between Pokemon. The same with Digimon.
?
4 - The trainer needs a device to create a Mega evolution. Digivices?
?
5 - The DNA symbol used in Mega evolution is also used in Digievolutions.
?
6 - The sentimental link between the Pokemon and the trainer is the same with the Digimon and his chosen ones.
?
7 - The level of power used by Mega forms of Pokemon is extremely high and could equate to some strong Digimon.
?
8 - The appearance of Mega Pokemon is just a modification of the original form, just like Digimon.
?
9 - They will even shout ""Mega evolve Charizard!"" , Identical to Digimon!
?
Needless to mention that Porygon is practically a Digimon. He could easily connect the two worlds.
?
But the fact is that these Mega evolving Pokemon is a blatant copy of Mega Digievolutions. And I believe this will be the starting point for a meeting between the two universes, especially now with Namco Bandai and Nintendo working together.
?
Below are some images of the facts:

you can also view it here:

This week's Pokemon is Rapidash!

#078 Rapidash (Japanese ????? Gallop)
The Fire Horse Pokemon
Rapidash usually can be seen casually cantering in the fields and plains. However, when this Pokemon turns serious, its fiery manes flare and blaze as it gallops its way up to 150 mph.

#077 Ponyta (Japanese ???? Ponyta)
The Fire Horse Pokemon

However, even with a guarantee of 3 IVs, you have about a 1/30000 chance of getting a perfect 6 IV one that you want (~1/6000 if it's 5IV) - and if you're shooting for a hidden power, I'd imagine that chances are quite lower.
Which, of course, would encourage you to just hack to get the legendary exactly how you want.
How common is this on the more ""pro"" side of things? I know the drama from the dream-ball Aegislash, but is Nintendo going to go actually disqualify someone because they have a team of perfect IV legendaries?

I'm not sure if this is the proper subreddit to post on, but it being Pokemon related, I thought maybe I could get some help here.
To get on topic real quick, I've stumbled upon an old GamBoy Advance SP with Pokemon FireRed.
So many years passed by since I have played the old games, having lost many of my own through the years. It brought me to tears as I first clicked on the power button. Being greeted by professor Oak, it brought back many old memories.
Having own a Gameboy advance, this was my first time with a SP.
So, I've been checking online stores such as amazon and eBay for such games. (Pokemon blue, yellow, green, red, leaf green, emerald, gold, crystal, etc.)
And many seem to be in original boxes, going upwards to $200 each.
So, asking, does anyone happen to know of a place online or somewhere physically where I can buy these games for cheap?  I don't care for them being in their original box art, just wanting to re-live my childhood all over again.

You may be asking me now ""hey why don't you go on showdown?"" I do, but I prefer to play on the actual game because I like to see the models, move animations and all that other great stuff. Its just extremely frustrating sitting on my 3DS going through people who say that they want to battle and then they don't accept. Let me know how you feel about this situation.

Pikachu is a starter or easily obtainable in the beginning of every single game. He's only a starter in Yellow, only catchable early in Kanto and Kalos (and even then rare to find), and he's not even obtainable in Gen 5.
Pokemon say their names in the game. How would that even work with different languages?
All the protagonists are 10. Yet another misconception created by the anime. Kanto protagonists were 11, and the Johto and Sinnoh protagonists are assumed to be the same age. Hoenn protagonists are 12, Unova protagonists are around 14, and Kalos protagonists are teenagers, most likely 16.

Any other misconceptions I'm missing?

After my first run, i pretty much let my imagination fill in the story. 
Last year i finally updated from my GBA and got a 3DS, So went out and bought second hand copys of all the old pokemon games that came out on the DS/3DS platform. One thing that is really irritating me from all the games, is as time goes on, the games get more and more dialogue, Normally in the way of adding more people to follow the main charater. 
While its great for the plots of the later games, it makes re playability less, and really annoys the shit outta me having to spam A through their constant ""Oh hi main character, You really don't want to talk to us, but we are gonna have another progression interrupting chat"" 
Im noticing it a lot more now then i did for the first play through, And having recently replayed pokemon Yellow, I noticed the dialogue was far less.
Now im playing through Pokemon Black, and jeezus christ, Cheren and Bianca and Prof Juniper drive me mad checking in every damn 10 min. 
one of the things i love in hindsite about Gold was that after the runaround with MrPokemon quest at the start of the game, Prof elm is a good professor in that he doesn't bother you (minus the Egg crap, but if you box the egg he doesn't call you until you have 8 badges)
TL;DR - Why did the games move away from Less dialogue and lots of freedom towards More dialogue and less freedom?

After putting it in I saw the alert for the Johto starters. I had forgotten about them, so I decided to worry about it when I got home. I didn't send anything to the pokemon link in that game, and after uploading the pokemon he had, proceeded to erase his game so he could start fresh. After gettin his pokemon back into his game and coming home, I went into bank to pokemon link my AS game. I got my BP from it, but no Johto starters.

The most intriguing aspect is the whole ""southern Kalos"" speculation. Here's a photo I found online showing Kalos on top of the inspiration for the location, France. It's noticeable that the region doesn't cover the inspiration's landmass as a whole, so maybe the speculation could be true? I have no clue but that specific idea about the next games in the series interested me. It could be like B2/W2 where a new region is opened up. These new games could reveal a new Southern Kalos equipped with different gyms, routes, towns, etc. (kinda like in B2/W2). If they follow the Kyurem formula of B2/W2 then these future games could be true sequels of the original XY. I do enjoy that approach to a possible future game. Just thought to share my ideas. Enter in discussion because I do enjoy reading about speculation, but keep it clean please. If I made any mistake, point it out nicely. I'll be quick to fix it. http://imgur.com/77RLKDc

It seems to me that we usually get a very similar rotation of types for the gyms and Elite Four, and they usually fall into roughly the same order. Bug and Rock type gyms usually come quite early, for example, so that the players can take advantage of their defensive weaknesses, with more 'exotic' types like Ice and Fire coming later on. Yet the perceived weaknesses and rarity of the types in each game is really only enforced by the gym order and when we can begin to catch counter types for each. 
I would love to see Rock be weilded by a tougher leader. I feel as though it's low place in the usual order encourages the idea of the type as a flawed defensive option, but we know that, like Ice, it is an excellent offensive type. It would even present a challenge to the popular Fire and Ice types that might take a late game gym slot in most titles. I often overlook the type myself, but it has some real powerhouses that we hardly see: Tyranitar, Aggron, Aerodactyl and so on, and a good spread of type combos. I want more of a challenge than a couple of basic Fossil pokemon! 
I have a soft spot for Bug as well -- the heavy hitters in the type could be used to great effect if they got the opportunity. I k ow everyone wants a Dark type gym, but they often get seen in the Four or the enemy Team. 
How could we reshuffle things to really let some supposedly lacklustre types shine?

I think the next Pokemon game will come out in the first half of 2016 which is Pokemon's 20th anniversary. I think the next game will be Pokemon Z to expand on Zygarde's story since he has the moves 1000 arrows and 1000 waves. The main game will be set in Kalos and I'm not sure if they'll make the story a sequel or change X and Y's one.
After you have beat the main game you will have the option to go to Kanto and battle all of the gym leaders there. The reason I came up with this is, because of the 20th anniversary. I think this idea actually fits pretty well since Kalos had a lot of Kanto Pokemon and a lot of Kanto references. For example it had all the Kanto legendaries besides Mew and you could choose one of the Kanto starters.
So this is my theory about the next Pokemon game and I admit it does sound a bit crazy, but it doesn't sound too out of this world. Tell me what you think of it.

If you are unsatisfied with some aspect of Pokemon, let GameFreak know.
Email. Facebook. Twitter. Game feedback surveys on Nintendo Club. Whatever.
Let them know, because until you do, your opinions and preferences are being replaced by the best guess of marketers and game designers who get very little feedback.
And I don't know about you, but I don't like being dismissed and lumped into the ""gamers these days don't focus on one game or want a challenge.""
As much as I love the new features GameFreak adds to the games, they are not enough on their own to keep my interest, and they never stay.  Secret Bases are going to be gone again next generation.  We probably won't get character customization back outside Kalos, and as much as I'd love to believe otherwise, Soaring and  Dexnav are probably going to go away too. 
I have loved this game series since the original games came out (hell, I'm writing a fanfic of it), but 15+ years is a long time to do the same thing over and over.  I stopped playing for awhile because things got too repetitive, and don't want to have to leave again just because I'm considered a ""loyal customer"" who'll keep buying new games no matter what they do with them.
So I'm going to let them know that just focusing on new players is not going to keep all of their old ones happy.  And hope that's incentive enough for them to make games that I WANT to keep buying, rather than stop again and wish that more mature/challenging pokemon games existed outside of romhacks.
Edit:
Thanks for the support guys. Remember this isn't just a grouchfest: it's a Call to Action.  
Other than the methods above, it would be great if we could get a translation for GameFreak's contact page at http://gamefreak.co.jp/contact.html so we know how to use that. Any Japanese speakers able to provide instructions, or if there's an easy way to translate the page that I'm missing, let me us know. 
Also, /u/illuzian started a petition here if that's your speed.  
Just try to do something, and hopefully we'll demonstrate to Game Freak that enough of their playerbase is actually concerned about this sort of thing.

a) It's ideal to maximize the EVs of a pokemon while he's level 1, so he'll have those EV advantages in stats while evolving from level 1 to 100?
b) I don't quite know how to find and know the perfect IVs from a wild pokemon. Would someone explain it? :(

I have been here in this subreddit for over two years and we just might be the biggest Pokemon community there is. The amount of users have doubled during my time here and it is so good to see that even nearly after 20 years Pokemon keeps going strong.
Last week, I met a girl who shares my passion for Pokemon and I'd really like to surprise her with some nice Pokemon art which would relate to us, so why not show her the power of community full of enthusiastic and eager Pokemon trainers?
So, if you like drawing and feel like you have the time to help me out I would be ever so grateful. So here's the thing: my favorite Pokemon is Mew and she really likes Azumarill a lot. This is how I came up with the idea of a drawing: Azumarill and Mew playing together!
It does not matter whether you are a beginner, a pro or just like drawing occasionally. Even sketches are good enough. I'll take in everything. And receiving even one drawing would make my day.
I give you my sincere thanks!

First Off. I don't want this to be some cheap game where the phone buzzes when a Pokemon wants to battle you.  I want a game exactly like what the Pokemon April Fools Day Video. (If you haven't seen it watch it here, https://youtu.be/4YMD6xELI_k) People are actually saying that that video could've actually been the beta for the real game. WHO KNOWS! But anyway I want a game exactly like that. Nothing more nothing less. I just want a game that gets the Pokemon that correspond to your current location. (What was funny was that the guy in the video had on a pokemon go logo shirt. lel) Choose any starter from every region to date and just walk around Catching em all!
Next, I want to be able to battle friends and gym leaders. They can obviously make the battle and trade system, but i think the gym leader system may surprise you... It should be like a level up system to your gym badges. Pretty much saying, when you battle another play of a higher or equal level, you level up and gain a gym badge.
Lastly, eSports and street safety. If the game is exactly like what i described then the game should recognize streets. Sooner or later a parent is going to file a law suit on The Pokemon Company because his or her child got hit by a car. We don't want that. So here's what should be put in place. A system when where you get too close to a street your phone buzzes for 30 seconds until you move back, with ""WARNING: STREET INCOMING"" On your screen in red, and then when you walk way to close to the street it will stop working until you move back or cross the street. But all Pokemon you saw will still stay in it's original position before it shut off. And here's the deal with eSports. eSports is RAPIDLY growing in the gaming and sports communities, so Nintendo should hop on that bandwagon. Think about this. Tons of thousands of people, gathered around one stadium watching two people and their Pokemon duke it out. Every seat has a screen where the viewer can watch from every camera angle in case they don't have a phone. Or people that have their own phones can watch. But while doing this Nintendo should make it so people except for the registered players in a certain area can send out their Pokemon. We don't want some random troll sending out his LVL.100 Greninja on the battle field, while two people are still battling. Also the ""Pokemon League"" (as I will tentatively call it from now on) should be open to ANYONE who has all 8 Gym Badges. And has Pokemon that are LVL.55 or Higher.
But yeah thats about it :P
TL;DR: Game should be just like this vid: https://youtu.be/4YMD6xELI_k
level up gym leader system.
A real life Pokemon League

9074	"About Zygarde's new forms"	"7"	"8"	"20150914"	"daftphonics14[Best girl]"	"I'm entirely sure about the core and cell forms, but I can shed some light on the inspiration behind Zygarde's other formations. So in Norse mythology, Loki has three children: Hel(a female humannoid), Fenrir(a wolf), and Jormungandr(a serpent). More on that here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loki#Prose_Edda
I looked into Zygarde(50% power) on Bulbapedia and they say that it has simlarities to Niohoggr and Jormungandr.  Check it out here: http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Zygarde_(Pok%C3%A9mon)#Origin
As far as the other two forms are considered,  the 10% power form is most likely drawing inspiration from Fenrir and its final form is from Hel. But that can be flawed since Hel is a woman. But it's fun to speculate. I love learning about where Ken Sugimori and the other illustrators get their inspiration for their pokemon designs. So if you share the same interest as me, feel free to talk about! I want to discuss^

9076	"Next Pokemon game theory?"	"2"	"4"	"20150914"	"tailztyrone-lol"	"TLDR AT THE BOTTOM.
So in an interview a couple of days ago, one of the developers/programmers for Gamefreak hinted that the next Pokemon game will be about ""flowers"".
First thing that came to my mind is AZ's Floette and what it could be,
Those who don't know, AZ's Floette was introduced in X/Y but could only be obtained by using cheats, now my theory, is that after revealing that Zygarde will most likely be split into multiple forms, I believe that because Zygarde was found in a cave, that he was restrained there by Arceus since Arceus must have created Zygarde to create the world.
Now Zygarde could not contain his power and feared that somebody else might be able to control him to create World Destruction.
Zygarde asked Arceus to split him into different cores and scatter them accross the regions, Zygarde had somehow absorbed enough core's to become his current 50% form which is the snake like form we know him for right now.
Because of Zygarde's cores being scattered all over, Arceus created AZ's Floette to watch over Zygarde and bring him more cores in time of need.
Now what would the plot of the next game be? Who knows, Anything could happen at this point because there is no official post from Gamefreak/Nintendo about the plot, just what it will be about.
Please remember that this is all just theory/random guess so don't be so harsh >3<
Thanks for reading all the way through if you did.
TLDR; Zygarde wanted to be split so his 100% form can't be controlled, Arceus made AZ's Floette to bring Zygarde the cores when he needs restore the land to peace.

For many years, I used to play Pokemon, but then came a time where I got older in high school, and Pokemon fell out of fashion. Not just this, but I also got into other games on the PS3, and then onto PC gaming. While I could just emulate some of these games, it's just not the same. I've pretty much bought every on/off handheld (by this I mean, from Gameboy Color, to the SP, to the DS Lite, skipping Gameboy Advance and DS original). 
I've owned:


Game
Gen



Red

Ruby
3


Emerald

FireRed

Diamond
4


SoulSilver

I've been contemplating getting back into Pokemon, and burn time into Black 1, Black 2, (or white, I'm not sure yet), X/Y, and Omega Ruby, especially Omega Ruby, since 3rd gen was my favorite of all time, and it'd be neat to take a trip down memory lane on a revitalized version of Ruby (yes, I've heard there are some stark differences in some cases).
Anyways, I've the option to buy a variety of systems at this current point in time. There's a 3DS, the 3DS XL, and the NN3DS (XL, since it isn't optional). I was originally going to buy the NN3DS, since it was going to have compatibility with 3DS games, but also have new games exclusive to itself, but I've heard tale that Nintendo is going to release something new next year, which may incorporate a combination of home console/handheld. Thus, here is my quandary. Do I spend time waiting to see what Nintendo may be releasing (Fall?) 2016 and may or may not have backwards compatibility, or do I go forth and purchase the NN3DS, with hopes that Pokemon games going forward are supported on this device?
Aside: I was originally going to post this in the question thread, but considered that due to the nature (and length) of the question, it might necessitate the need for its own thread.

Assuming this is the case, it would take place in Kalos and expand on the region, as sequels have always done. I was thinking with trainer customization being a thing in Kalos, it's possible that a player's Greninja will change appearance to match the customized player, in the same way the leaked Ash-Greninja form happens when Ash's and Greninja's bond reaches a limit. I could see this sort of thing happening through maxing friendship or affection.
Any other thoughts on how this Ash-Greninja bond mechanic might be implemented in a game, if at all?

I do see the appeal, but it just doesn't feel quite as much as a battle theme to me - it's shorter than the other themes in the game, it seems a lot more repetitive (the melody only lasts around forty seconds before looping), it doesn't have the standard ""intro"" segment at the beginning (a small part that doesn't loop when the rest does) that pretty much every other theme has, etc. Now, this doesn't make it bad - it just doesn't sound as good to me personally, what with encounter themes generally following a different format from encounter themes.
That said, Colress' theme is also a remix of his encounter theme, but his, while it keeps the same melody, is ""reformatted,"" with a proper battle intro that is completely different from that of his encounter theme, different harmonies and percussion to sound more like a battle theme, and so on; it's also over twice as long as Wally's theme, despite their respective encounter themes being almost the same length (and Wally's actually being longer).
That said, the ""straight-up remix"" idea might have actually appealed more to others - it's still a very powerful theme, even if I personally didn't like the direction it took - and I know a lot of people loved that electric guitar. cx
So, just out of curiosity, which theme do you prefer? And separately, not counting the themes themselves, but the METHODS by which they were remixed (that is, straight-up remaster versus remix), which style do you prefer?
As you could probably tell, I prefer the style of Colress' theme, but again, I certainly see the appeal to Wally's theme, and I like the song on its own even if I don't think it works as a battle theme specifically, so I'm just interested to see other thoughts. C:
EDIT: Made a minor correction on their lengths.

They love the 3ds games (pokemon x and y) too. So, I'd like to do a bit of a pokemon theme for their christmas gifts this year. I have no idea what sort of things are available, but I'm assuming there's a pretty wide array of things to choose from. Can you suggest pokemon things which might be ideal for this? Links to them would be even better. Thank you all!

"66"	"137"	"20151005"	"Suicune94much roam, so flee"	"For instance, I used to be really indifferent towards Zygarde - it just seemed like the lame irrelevant cousin of Xerneas and Yveltal, sitting in a cave all day and being another dragon/ground type. I guess I also didn't really 'get' its design, and I thought the hexagons were just there because the creators were stuck for ideas. However, with all the new leaks and info, Zygarde makes so much more sense to me. Due to the revealing of the Zygarde cells, Zygarde's name finally makes sense (relating to zygotes), and so do the hexagons which illustrate them and are carried through all of Zygarde's forms. Also, the Norse mythology behind the different forms is pretty well thought out too, and it's really great that Game Freak must have had this all planned since XY, yet they managed to hide it so well. Now I absolutely love Zygarde's design because it makes so much more sense, and all that detail was there for a reason! What Pokemon do you appreciate better, now that you know more about them?

Here in Canada, Season 9 of Pokemon, Battle Frontier, has been re-airing, which has reminded me of my sheer disappointment about the Battle Frontier being left out of OR/AS. When I pre-ordered both games, there was no doubt in my mind it would be included, it just didn't make any sense for it not to be. Had I known prior, I would have still bought a game but I don't think I would have pre-ordered both.
Don't get me wrong, OR/AS is a great game and definitely worth playing but I would be lying if I said the lack of Symbols didn't affect my overall opinion of the game. Some people agree with me, some people don't, but I have yet to come across a person who says OR/AS wouldn't have benefited from bringing back the Battle Frontier.

For starters I apologize for the potential block of text that is about to follow.
I¡¦m typically the kind of redditor who just browses and upvotes/downvotes post without contributing much to the discussions. That being said, I had to speak my mind on a particular subject. 
Why hasn¡¦t Nintendo implemented a real time Pokemon app?!? Basically by that I envision an app that allows you to build up your very own Pokemon team and battle other players through the app. You could catch Pokemon based on a particular location that you are at or by the number of steps you have taken in real time. When you pass by another trainer with the app you can battle their team. 
I am currently attending an engineering school for civil engineering (hence the name), and know nothing about application development, so this potential app might be rather difficult or impossible to implement, but with the resources Nintendo has, it seems like it could be manageable. If an application for smartphones is too much of a stretch, the 3DS already has StreetPass and a step counter, so it would seem possible to develop a game on the 3DS capable of emulating Pokemon in real life. 
As far as the application or game goes I have talked to friends who agree that it would be super fun and enjoyable. We have spitballed plenty of ideas such as setting a home location where you can revive fainted Pokemon much like a Pokemon Center, having in app/game currency, and locations where you can buy items like a PokeMart. 
So Reddit, what do you think? Is this a pipe dream or is this possible to impliment?

Throw in the fact that Desser City (Dubai look-alike) is in a dimension different of Ash's, so the movie doesn't take place in the main world, meaning the legends living there are different.
Unless by some odd chance ONE of the legends is from his universe (nodnod-lugia)
EDIT: Actually Dialga/Palkia/Giratina might not either. IIRC the distortion world balances the real world, so it should stand to reason there's a distortion world for every real world, therefore multiple Giratinas?

So we got pokeballs. Literally anybody can get one, it costs 200 yen, or about 2 dollars in every store. It's as common as bubblegum. Even younger children are clearly seen buying them.
That confuses me. Pokeballs are actually veru much advanced pieces of tech. They not only have some sort of matter teleportation technology, powerful enough to capture gods and giant monsters perfectly, mind you, but they double as a quantum storage facility for living things. They store living beings as data, just like USB drives carry your data in 1s and 0s. People may take this for granted, but this is very sci fi. This is something I would expect to see in star wars or halo, alongside intergalactic space ships and energy swords. But that's not all, the mystery thickens. In the Johto region, people supposedly used pokaballs for much longer than we thought, even going as far as using various fruit shells as components. That's some mcguyver level stuff right there. Don't forget about  a network of computers which can store those same monsters in capsules as data in computers, and even take your pokeballs and save them too. 
But Pokemon universe isn't that sci fi, is it? We barely see cars, most of the area is overgrown by forests, hell people don't even have basic weapons, for the most part. In some areas, you could take the advanced poke tech away, and you would think it's the  past. Technology on this scale, and this same technology being used on what equals as a sport, mind you, doesn't even make any sense, you don't see a industrial revolution on the scale it would be necessary to make and deliver all these products. 
So unless we people in this universe are a bunch of dumbasses and quantum tech/matter teleportation is as easy as apple pie, how is this all even possible? We clearly see people using televisions, cell phones, even some sort of ios devices, so they can't be backwards people. I mean, you have to go into space to launch a television satellite.

You may either choose what Mon you get or find another way of choosing!
You May Not use the dream radar legendaries!
You must nickname every pokemon you catch and then put them into the PC!

I'm looking for someone to do this challenge with me. For those who don't know, Nuzlocke is a harder way of playing Pokemon. Here's the basic rules:
-You can only catch the first Pokemon in each area. If you kill it or it flees, there are no do-overs. You also can't save before you enter an area, then keep reloading your game until you find a Pokemon you want.
-You must nickname all Pokemon to create a better bond with your Pokemon. -If a Pokemon faints, you must either release it or put it in the PC, never to be used in this playthrough again.
The extra Soul Link rules change the challenge a little, and are as follows:
-Each Pokemon you catch in an area is linked with the Pokemon your partner(s) catch. If one of those Pokemon is boxed, so are the ones that are linked with it. Simultaneously, if a Pokemon 'dies', any Pokemon it is linked with also 'dies'. 
-[OPTIONAL] Players cannot have more than one Pokemon with a first type in the total of all parties. So, you can have Bulbasaur (Grass/Poison) and Koffing (Poison), but not Bulbasaur and Sunkern (Grass)

As Pokemon moves more and more towards a higher quality age, we're beginning to see certain things occuring. Cutscenes, to be exact. With the addition of the 3D, those fully rendered scenes that we imagined as kids are finally becoming a reality. What does this have to do with voice acting?
Maybe it's just me, but does anyone else find it the slightest bit awkward when you see a fully animated character doing something, and everything is building up to them talking to you. And they walk up and their mouth opens and...
Text. A text box. Not that this is a HUGE problem by any means, but I feel the immersion takes a bit of a hairline fracture when the extent of a character's sound is the beep of the text box. I'm not asking for every line of the game to be fully voiced. That'd just get obnoxious. But for important cutscenes where we're absorbed in the world, I think it would at least improve the experience.
Also this is probably impossible but I'd also like the BuzzNav to get voice-acting simply because it's my favorite Nav. I like the idea of it being like the radio in HGSS where you can just hear it while still doing whatever, kind of like listening to a podcast while you work or equivalent.
Now, keep in mind that this is my opinion, but I wanted to see if maybe anyone else was on board with this. Anyone?

""For Raikou, the time needs to be between 00 and 20 minutes past the hour, for Entei the time needs to be between 20 and 40 minutes past the hour and for Suicune, the time needs to be between 40 and 00 minutes past the hour.""
whatever I do, I believe I have all the pre-requisite., I just can't seem to catch or make them appear. I can see the area on where to catch them. Even the portal. But so far, nothing. 
Info:
I have Alpha Sapphire - with update ver 1.2
Party: ( be sure to have 2 legendaries including Lugia - in your party ) 
*Lugia(level 50)
*Deoxy
*Rayquaza
*Charizard
*Pikachu
*Butterfree
What Triggered the issue
? Basically, changing the time on your DS causes the Game system time to ""reset"" or put to stop. Which in turn, most of the legendary pokemons that requires a specific time as it's pre-requisite wont appear. 
The fix is wait 48 hours after you change your system time.
Shoutout to Will-TVR for the pro tip.
Bonus info
If you want to capture the Trio dogs in an hour, just have Lugia in your party, and everytime you catch a legendary dog, go back to town and deposit Lugia into the Computer box. Save your game, withdraw Lugia and proceed to Trackless forest again and capture the other dog. Do the process again for the last dog. Viola!

Over the last two days I participated in r/pokemon's VGC tournament, and managed to win the thing. Here's a report of my matches (note: it's really long. Part 1 is my team, 2 is the swiss matches without replays, and 3 is the top cut, with replays.)
The Team: World XI
During the top 8, the streamers mentioned one of my pokemon seemed to be names after a WWE fighter, but that he didn't know much about WWE. At some point someone pointed out to them that these were all soccer references, which made me laught. In other words, this team is the World XI.
I hadn't made a serious VGC team since the start of the format. The team I made then did pretty well, but due to changes in the meta, I figured it was best I made a new one. I struggled with a lot of different things before eventually going back to the basics.
Zlatan (Kangaskhan) @ Kangaskhanite
Ability: Scrappy
EVs: 4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Spe
Jolly Nature
Return
Power-Up Punch
Sucker Punch
Fake Out

On what Zlatan bought his wife for her birthday:
¡¨Nothing, she already has Zlatan.¡¨

Ah, Kangaskhan. Nothing to see here. I didn't want to mess around too much, so I went with the tried and trusted strategy of using the best pokemon possible.
Messi (Articuno) @ Charti Berry
Ability: Pressure
EVs: 252 HP / 60 Def / 164 SpA / 12 SpD / 20 Spe
Bold Nature
Freeze-Dry
Tailwind
Protect
Hurricane

So named because he's blue and Messi is best known for wearing his blue Argentina kit.

Articuno was here to hit Grass types, rain dance, water types, and fighting types. It also could set up tailwind. I brought it to two battles. It was useful in one of those. Essentially, I wanted something to shut down rain teams, and this was it, but I didn't face any rain teams. It was an experiment, but I didn't trust it to KO the things I needed it to ¡V fighting types and grass types ¡V so it sat on the bench most of the day. 
Silva (Landorus-Therian) @ Assault Vest
EVs: 68 HP / 252 Atk / 188 Spe
Adamant Nature
Rock Slide
Earthquake
Superpower
Knock Off

You can't say 'I'll sell Silva and buy a similar player'. There are no similar players around, only worse ones. - Alessandro Nesta

I'm a big fan of Assault vest Landorus. It still hits like a truck, and doesn't die to stray HP ice. It also wins games by letting you switch moves. The Kang/Lando core was crucial to my old team, and I knew I was using it again. Again, if it works, why change it?
Neuer (Heatran) @ Leftovers
EVs: 180 HP / 252 SpA / 72 Spe
Modest Nature
Heat Wave
Substitute
Flash Cannon
Protect

The spectator tends not to remember that as a goalkeeper I make difficult saves at great risk and start moves with my efforts."" - Manuel Neuer 

Heatran covered up my big fairy weakness, while also eating up will-o-wisps directed at Kang and Lando. I ran flash cannon over earth power specifically for that reason. I love sub-protect heatran. It draws so much attention to it, and nothing is more satisfying than protecting behind a sub and watching your opponent double into it. 
Vidal (Virizion) @ Life Orb
EVs: 252 Atk / 4 Def / 252 Spe
Jolly Nature
Taunt
Protect
Close Combat
Leaf Blade

They have arguably the most complete midfield player in world football within their ranks. That man, of course, is Juventus¡¦ Arturo Vidal.

This spot was originally for Terrakion, but I swapped it to Virizion when I realized how I had nothing to take a water type attack. Virizion deals with Kangaskhan while also putting the hurt on bulky waters. It also avoids rage powder and is a safe switch in against amoongus. It also has taunt, which combined with its speed lets me shut down annoying strategies. Virizion puts in work. My team's MVP, hands down.
Ronaldo (Milotic) @ Sitrus Berry
Ability: Competitive
EVs: 236 HP / 140 Def / 132 SpA
Modest Nature
Scald
Icy Wind
Recover
Protect

As sexy as he is good at soccer, and he is very, very good at soccer

Milotic was the other pokemon which came up huge for me. It ended up getting a good number of competitive boosts, and was bulky enough to take a lot of hits. I rarely used recover, and I'm thinking about dropping it for ice beam. The sheer presence of milotic helps me dictate lead match-ups, and it's bulky enough to take all sorts of weak hits. Icy Wind was another form of speed control, which ended up doing some real damage thanks to competitive.
Swiss rounds
Note: I don't remember everything about my swiss matches, and I couldn't save replays. I saved the replays for my top cut matches, however. Here's what I remember.
Round 1 against Greiver1337:
I came into the battle and I remember being nervous, because the team looked pretty standard but had some match-ups I hadn't tested against. In particular, gengar was intimidating. It turned out my opponent hadn't really played much VGC. He ended up using sludge wave mega-gengar, which hit his own whimsicott. I don't remember anything else about the battle, but it was a comfortable win. Greiver1337 seemed to turn it around, however, since he went 5-2 and just missed top cut - 10th place. We spoke briefly about his team, so I assume he switched it up a bit before the ensuing rounds.
1-0
Round 2 against Edavis707:
Davis ended up coming in 9th place, meaning I beat both the players who just bubbled out. This was a great match. I don't remember exactly what happened, but I remember it ended with my heatran against all 4 of his pokemon, all weakened. My heatran, hiding behind a sub, managed to not miss with heatwave enough to get him down to Charizard-Y, which had no good way of damaging me. I ended up winning with 8% HP on Heatran, so it went down to the wire.
2-0
Round 3 against Morga95:
Morga ended up coming in 7th overall, also cutting at 5-2. This was another great match. I knew he was running trick room from the offset, seeing Hariyama, Gothitelle, and Mawile. Against teams which require set-up, I ran my standard Kangaskhan-Virizion lead. He lead Gothitelle-Hariyama, as expected. Gothitelle protected on my taunt, and I faked out Hariyama. I looked up Gothitelle on Pokemon-GL, and noticed that only 14% run mental herb, so I figured I was safe taunting it. In hindsight, he saw one taunt and probably would have expected a second had he not had a mental herb, so taunting a second time was probably a bad idea. I also ran a calc and saw that most Jolly Kangaskhan with return can do enough to KO Hariyama from where it was at. As such, I returned into Hariyama and taunted Gothitelle. Hariyama survived with 1% health, and close combatted Kang to get the KO. On the other hand, Virizion's taunt was dealt with by a mental herb, and I had no shot of coming back once he put up trick room. After the battle, Morga mentioned his Hariyama had extra physical bulk, which was the deciding factor. He also apologized for a critical hit poison jab(?) to KO Virizion, although I think he would have won regardless. 
2-1
Round 4 against Nyle420 and Round 5 against NoRiceForP:
Following the pattern, Nyle420 came in 11th place. NoRiceForP had one loss all tournament, and ended up in 3rd. I confess, I don't remember anything at all about one of these games. I do remember the other one, but I can't figure out who was who, so they both get clumped together. 
One of these guys had a sun team. I remember that my goal was to get him down to just charizard, since heatran would finish the game off from there. I ended up having Heatran, Landorus, and Virizion against Charizard, and got caught off guard by HP ground on charizard. However, I did end up winning because rock slide didn't miss (thank god).
The other match I remember more clearly because I was playing against a chansey. He also brought amoongus, Kangaskhan, and rotom-w(??). All 4 of the pokemon he brought were dealt with by Virizion, which was key to this battle. I remember leading with Kang and Virizion against amoongus and Kangaskhan (or chansey, I don't remember). I faked out Kangaskhan and taunted amoongus, but of course amoongus had a mental herb. He managed to get Kangaskhan to sleep, which played a big part of the battle. I can't recall exactly what happened, but a lot of switching occurred. One turn, I saw a will-o-wisp coming into one of my pokemon and switched in my sleeping Kangaskhan. Kangaskhan slept for the maximum of 5 turns, and was burned as soon as it woke up. This game had me on my feet, because I had to conserve Virizion as much as possible while also keeping threats on the field. I ended up with heatran (behind a substitute) and virizion on the field against amoongus and chansey. Amoongus used rage powder, which doesn't effect Virizion, allowing me to KO chansey with Close Combat. Amoongus then went down to a heat wave, and the battle was effectively over.
4-1
Round 6 against foolish_swami:
Foolish_swami ended up going undefeated in swiss, going into top cut as the #1 seed. He had a pretty standard team, but had mamoswine on it. I led with Kangaskhan and Milotic against Mamoswine and Ttar. He had protect on Ttar, which he used turn 1. That should have tipped me off to the item, but I was oblivious. Icy wind and fake out did little to Mamoswine. I then made the mistake, which was power-up punching Ttar. It survived with ~30% and its weakness policy kicked in, Koing my Kangaskhan with rock slide after mamoswine did its part. Milotic had a bit of Hp left after the sitrus berry kicked in. I switched in Virizion, and I used scald and Leaf Blade on Mamoswine and Ttar respectively. Ttar went down, but mamoswine survived on 1% and hit back, Koing something or the other. That's all she wrote. I probably forgot a turn here or there, but the decision to use scald instead of leaf blade on Mamoswine might have lost me the game. I wasn't sure if scald would do enough to Ttar, and didn't want to risk it. Thinking about it, I might have led with articuno, since I think I had a tailwind up. Whatever, it was a great game and I learned from it.
4-2
Round 7 against FunkyToucan. 
I was at 4-2 with the best tiebreak score of all players in the tournament, so all I needed to do was win to get in to the top 8 ¡V no bubble angst required. I don't remember much about this match, but I do remember it being very close. I do remember him using thunder wave on Kangaskhan with his rotom-w, instead of thunderbolting milotic. I was fairly certain that lost him the game, although having un-paralyzed Kangaskhan might have dealt with him anyhow. 
5-2
At the end of swiss, I had gone 5-2, and played against players ranked #1, 3, 7, 9, 10, 11, and 20. As such, I got the top seed among x-2 finishers, and ended up #4. Not playing against any teams with confusion on it was pretty awesome, and the one smeargle I saw was taunted pretty easily. The Chansey I saw was a pain, but it never got a minimize off and was very well used. I was pretty happy with the team I had just built, although I hadn't used articuno much at all. Virizion is pretty good against rain on its own, so I might not have needed it as much as I did when I ran terrakion. I faced a lot of amoongus, and never felt confident with Articuno against it ¡V although between heatran and virizion, dealing with it was pretty easy. We could use 3 teams in this tournament, and I had only used 1, so I had the chance to do some testing before the next day and possibly change up my team. I didn't want to go into the knock out rounds cold with my old team, even if it had served me well in the past, so I resolved to fix up my current team instead.
I did this by adding in Latios for Articuno. Articuno originally was there to hit water types, grass types, dragon types, flying types, and set up tailwind. Latios does the latter 3 with Ice beam, and most grass types are also part poison. Here's the set I ran:
Messi (Latios) @ Focus Sash
Ability: Levitate
EVs: 4 Def / 252 SpA / 252 Spe
Timid Nature

Psychic
Ice Beam
Protect
Tailwind

I debated the item choice for a long time, but I ended up going with the oft-unused focus sash. I couldn't use sitrus berry because of milotic, nor could I use Life Orb because of Virizion. In the end, I'm pretty content with the focus sash, because it gives me some reassurance that I'll get the KO's I need to get, even if I do have reasonably bulk. The only thing I do regret is using psychic over psyshock. While this never came up in the tournament, psychic has the ability to ohko Amoongus which don't invest in SpD. However, most amoongus switch out when they see Latios, and psyshock would do enough in most cases anyhow. On the other hand, psyshock actually lets Latios beat Sylveon which don't run quick attack, which could come in handy.
Top 8 against ET3RN4M
Game 1 Game 2 Game 3
Set with my new team, I entered my battle against Eternam. This was the only round of 8 match which wasn't a rematch, so I had no idea what to expect. His pokemon were Suicune, Landorus, Hydreigon, Metagross, Thundurus, and Terrakion. I knew Metagross was his mega. I also assumed he wouldn't lead with Landorus because of my milotic. As such, I was pretty comfortable leading with two physical attackers in Virizion and Kangaskhan. 
He led with Metagross and Suicune. Now, most metagross run protect, and most suicune don't, so I figured it was a safe bet that he would switch suicune (in fear of leaf blade) and protect with metagross to avoid fake out. As such, I power up punched into suicune, hoping to get the +2 boost. Instead, suicune protected and metagross KO'd my Virizion with zen headbutt. Ouch. I needed to play aggressively to get back into the game, so I sucker punched metagross and protected heatran. He got a sub up, and from there it was pretty much game. I played out the game, however, and watched his -2 Landorus nearly KO my (60%) heatran with super power, telling me he was running choice band Lando ¡V very important information. 
0-1
This time around I led with Kangaskhan and Latios. I knew he had a fast team, and I wanted to get tailwind up. I also knew I could power-up punch my own Latios if I felt like a protect was coming. Latios had a favorable match-up against this team ¡V hitting 4 pokemon super effectively ¡V so not bringing it game 1 was probably dumb. He led Terrakion-Thundurus. I had to fake out Terrakion ¡V most have a focus sash and it could KO my Kangaskhan if I didn't. I fully expected a protect, but I couldn't take the risk. I also ice beamed into Thundurus, because I figured he would paralyze my pokemon, and tailwind wouldn't help much at that point. He actually switched Thundurus out into Metagross, who took my ice beam like a champ. However, Terrakion didn't protect, allowing me to break its sash. 
At this point I knew I could KO terrakion with psychic. Most Latios carry choice scarf, so I figured he would be caught off guard by me switching moves, and wouldn't switch out or protect. Even if he did switch, I would do a decent chunk of damage to any pokemon switching in bar Hydreigon. On the other hand, I expected metagross to set up a substitute. I couldn't sucker punch it, and I didn't want to switch out, so I went for the power up punch into it instead. Terrakion protected, and Metagross did a chunk of damage to my Latios with iron head. Meanwhile, I went up to +2 attack with Kang. I
figured sucker punch and psychic would be good enough, but he predicted that and quick guarded with terrakion ¡V stopping my sucker punch. My Latios is timid with max speed, and if his Metagross was max speed jolly nature we would speed tie (he claims it was, meaning I won the battle on a coin flip). Psychic got rid of terrakion, and then metagross knocked out Latios.
I brought in my milotic, expecting Landorus to come in and intimidate my Kangaskhan. However, Hydreigon came in instead. I wasn't optimistic, since scarf Hydreigon Draco meteor has a chance to KO Kangaskhan. I figured he would set up a substitute to avoid sucker punch, so I scalded into that slot and returned into Hydreigon, hoping I could survive or outspeed him. It turns out he wasn't running scarf, so I got the KO with return, and broke Metagross's sub with scald. A perfect turn. 
At this point, I went in to KO his thundurus with return, and hit metagross with another scald. I wasn't sure if he would substitute or not, so I opted not to risk sucker punching. It turns out he ran a slow thundurus, and I outsped and KO'd it. Metagross iron headed my Kang, but I scalded, and the damage had been done, and the game was basically over.
1-1
I didn't save game 3's replay, and I don't remember what happened. Oops. It was on stream, however, since I think ours was the only one to last that long. Anyhow, I managed a win, and got off into the semifinals.
2-1
Top 4 against Foolish_swami
Game 1
Game 2
Game 3
Up until this point, Foolish Swami hadn't dropped a single game yet. I had played Foolish Swami earlier, so I knew a little bit about his team. In particular, I should have known that Tyranitar has weakness policy and can survive a power up punch ¡V but I didn't remember that, because I'm stupid.
Latios + Kangaskhan was turning into my standard lead pretty quickly. I brought those against Ttar and Milotic. Afraid of a dark type attack, I switched in Virizion (with Justified), but he protected with Ttar and Milotic ate a fake out.
Here, I expected Ttar to switch out, staring down a Virizion close combat. As such, I went for a power up punch into it, hoping to get a +2 attack Kang and a leaf bladed milotic. If it weren't for his salamence's intimidate, Milotic would have been dead. Milotic was in kill range for sandstorm next turn, however.
Next turn I protected with Virizion, afraid of a flying type move and Kangaskhan's potential speed tie. I returned into Salamence, only to be met with a Chendalure. Milotic went down to sandstorm after firing off an icy wind, and in came Ttar.
I expected a will-o-wisp into Kangaskhan, and switched it out into Latios. What I got was a (choice scarf) heat wave, Koing Virizion before it could move. Ttar also froze Latios with an ice beam.
Next turn I hit his choice-locked Chandy with a sucker punch, Koing it, while tailwinding with my happily unfrozen Latios. Ttar protected, presumably afraid of fake-out. Now, at this point all he had left was Ttar and Salamence.
Here's where I misplayed: I needed to get rid of salamence before he mega-evolved. As such, I ice-beamed into the spot, hoping he wouldn't protect. Meanwhile, I power-up punched Ttar, hoping to boost Kangaskhan to a high enough attack to KO salamence next turn with sucker punch. Of course, he took the PuP like a champ and got the weakness policy boost, and KO'd by two pokemon with a rock slide. I also forgot that I had tailwind up, and could outspeed Mence regardless. Oops. He quickly dispatched of my Landorus and took the win.
0-1
Game two I lead with Kang and Landorus. I'm pretty confident he's not going to bring Milotic to start, and I want the ability to get rid of Ttar without worrying about Chandelure. He brings out Chandelure and Mamoswine, who I know is not scarfed. He assumes I can't fake out Chandulre, and protects with Mamoswine. I decide to fake out Chandelure anyways ¡V thanks scrappy ¡V by not mega-evolving. I also bring in Milotic to take a potential ice-type attack and dissuade a salamence switch-in. In hindsight, I could have simply sucked punched Chandelure and been done with it, but hindsight is 20/20. Of course, this Chandy wasn't running flash fire. It also wasn't running Infiltrator. Nope, it was running flame body. So of course I get burned through my own fake out. 
My sucker punch can't KO the Chandelure, so he gets off a heat wave. He also brings in Milotic to take my scald. Next turn I power up punch into milotic, mostly because Kangaskhan is useless otherwise. He predicts a sucker punch and switches Chandy into mamoswine, who eats a scald from my milotic, which (as I learned in the swiss rounds) doesn't quite KO. His milotic does damage to Kang with scald.
He protects with mamoswine, which makes sense ¡V Kangaskhan would likely KO it with sucker punch or PuP before it could move. I go ahead and Return into milotic, doing a good amount of damage, while he puts Kang into burn KO range with scald. I bring in Virizion for Milotic and then Milotic for Kangaskhan.
At this point, there's no way his pokemon survive another turn, both being down to 15% HP. I go for the simple scald-leaf blade, but first he ice shards into Virizion, bringing it down to the red. I didn't expect it to do that much, but I got what I needed.
Finally, his Salamences shows itself and boosts my full health Milotic. His target is Milotic, my Virizion will KO itself with LO recoil anyhow, so I protect milotic to get more pressure on my opponent. He heat wave and returns, getting rid of virizion but leaving Milotic intact and allowing landorus to show itself. A rock slide and icy wind would end the game.
1-1
Game 3 I lead with Kang Latios and he brings in Ttar and Mence. I fake out Ttar, knowing that Salamence would have to do something to avoid Latios. It switched out into Milotic, and I get a tailwind up safely.
Now, me being an idiot and all, I power up punch Ttar while protecting with Latios. My hope was that he would focus on Latios and I could get the boost and KO it next turn. Instead he rock sldies and Kang takes 60%. I power up punch into Ttar again, assuming I'll get the KO, but he protects. Milotic takes a psychic and uses icy wind. This was an odd call, since I had tailwind up and he could have KO'd Kangaskhan with scald. 
Now he switches out Ttar, avoiding the PuP with Chandelure. I bring in Milotic, expecting a Salamence switch in. He harmlessly ice beams into what was my Latios, and Kang drops to the point where sandstorm will KO it next turn.
At this point, I know I have to sucker punch with Kangaskhan to avoid getting hit by Chandelure. However, I expect Chandy to switch out to avoid getting hit by a sucker punch. I hit milotic with SP, Koing it, and KO Chandy with scald after taking a heat wave. Edit: This reasoning confused me... Essentially, I didn't want to risk losing Kang for nothing, so I went for the safest option and it paid off.
Ttar and Mence come in, boosting Milotic's Special Attack. On the other hand, my Latios comes in, threatening Mence. Knowing he has to protect, I set up tailwind while scalding into Ttar. Scald KO's Ttar and that effectively ended the game.
2-1
Finals against Gil4:
Now, the top 4 was not played simultaneously, meaning we all got to see the opposite side battle. I played first, and knowing I'd be in the championship game, I took notes on the Bo3 which I saw Gil4 and Serapis play. I took notes on both players and tossed out Serapis's stuff because I didn't need it. Here's what I wrote coming into the battle:

Conk @ Assault Vest (NO PROTECT), Iron Fist (NOT GUTS), Drain Punch, Ice Punch, Mach Punch + ?
Thundurus @ sitrus, tbolt, taunt, ?, ?
Togekiss ???
Heatran, flash cannon
Kangaskhan, PROTECT, return, sucker punch, PuP (NO FAKE OUT), not bulky, probably max speed

Togekiss, In the semi-finals, was brought once and died immediately. His last pokemon was never brought. The most notable thing I knew was that I would probably speed tie with Kangaskhan, but I didn't have to worry about Fake Out. That meant I could safely assume he would protect turn 1 if he led with it.
Also, note that this was a Best of 5 set.
Game 1
Game 2
Game 3
Game 1:
Not seeing intimidate and knowing his Kang doesn't have fake out, I'm happy to lead with my own Kangaskhan. I also bring Latios to deal with Conkeldurr, which he brings to go with Thundurus. 
Now, I know that Conkeldurr can't run protect, but I also know psychic wouldn't KO on its own. He doesn't have anything which wants to take a psychic, so I double into Conkeldurr, Koing it. He taunts my Latios to stop the non-existant tailwind play. In comes Togekiss.
Now, Togekiss can redirect my attacks, and Thundy doesn't pose a real threat to me beyond using thunder wave, so I go ahead and double into Togekiss. As intended, that Kos it, while thundurus does 35% with a thunderbolt on Kang. I also learn that Thundurus is not max speed, and probably not max SpA either, since Kang outsped it. Thunderbolt did paralyze me, however. Enter his Kangaskhan.
Knowing he can't fake out, I assume he will sucker punch my taunted Latios. I switch that out into Landorus, intimidating Kang. He tries to paralyze the Latios spot, and hits Kang with a PuP. Meanwhile, I get fully paralyzed. 
Now, I'm still not worried about Kangaskhan because of Virizion, so I double into Thundurus. Sucker punch does a chunk to Thundurus, and my Landorus-T surprises him by taking his HP ice (thank you, assault vest). Rock Slide brings it down to 10% or so before sitrus increases his HP back to the Yellow. At this point, he has to sucker punch my Kangaskhan, so I bring in Virizion safely. This might have been slightly risky, but the alternative was letting both my pokemon die. Landorus went down to a HP ice, but Virzion came in unscathed, and I got a second fake out to make use of. 
I went ahead with the fake out + close combat, and his Kangaskhan went down. On the other hand, my Kang was fully paralyzed, so he got off a thunderbolt to finish off Kang. I believe he would have had a shot if he had thunder waved Virizion while protecting with Kang, but he couldn't have known I'd get a full paralysis. In comes Latios, and the game is effectively over. 
1-0
Game 2:
I go ahead and keep the same leads, as does he. This time around, I know he wont taunt Latios, nor will he keep Conk in. As such, I double into Thundurus instead, nearly Koing it with Fake out and Ice beam. He switches out Conkeldurr into Togekiss. 
Now I keep it simple with Ice beam into Thundurus and Return into Togekiss. Even if he did use follow me, I'd get a KO. Instead, Thundurus switches out for Kang and Togekiss hits the red because of a crit. He gets up tailwind, however. 
Here I get a little cocky. He doesn't have fake out, so I didn't protect, but he went ahead and KO'd Latios with return anyhow. I believe I chose tailwind in order to avoid sucker punch, but it didn't make a difference. Kang took a dazzling gleam to the face but KO'd his Kangaskhan with return. 
He brought Thundurus back, while I brought in Landorus for its rock slide and ability to intimidate the conkeldurr he had sitting out back.
His only way of keeping one pokemon alive is by HP ice and air slashing Landorus. Going off that, I decide to sucker punch Thundurus, but end up trying to punch and incoming Conkeldurr. On the other hand, he got the air slash flinch on Landorus. 
At this point I considered my moves for a while. I figured he would mach punch my Kangaskhan, but he could also have chosen to ice punch my Landorus. I also knew that Virizion could only do around 50% to a conkeldurr. Because of this I chose to Sucker punch Togekiss and EQ with Landorus, which risked Koing my own Kangaskhan. It worked out, however, as his togekiss died to sucker punch and mach punch KO'd Kang, allowing EQ to hit Conkeldurr at full force as tailwing expired. 
Facing off against Thundy and Conk, I knew he couldn't protect. As such, Close Combat and rock slide more or less guaranteed the win, putting me up 2-0.
2-0
Game 3:
As tempting as it was to change leads, I only had to win 1 of the next 3 games to win the title. As such, I went with the same group of 4 once again. Meanwhile, he brought in Kang and Milotic. With no fake out to worry about, I predicted the protect from Kang. I PuPed Milotic and got tailwind up. Given that my opponent was staring down what was effectively a +2 +2 Mega-Kangaskhan, I was pretty confident I had the win. His ice beam did 75% to Latios, as he revealed a life orb on milotic. 
Here I was over-confident, and let Latios die to a sucker punch. I got rid of Kang wtith a +2 return, and didn't get burned by his scald. I ran some calcs on Conkeldurr vs Kangaskhan and found that at -1 it would do a max of 50% on me with mach punch, meaning I could live it if I brought in Landorus. However, that meant giving milotic a huge boost. 
As planned, mach punch didn't quite KO Kangaskhan, and Conkeldurr went down to a +2 return. Meanwhile, Landorus KO'd Milotic with Knock Off, which really surprised me ¡V then again, I suppose LO milotic isn't that bulky. Togekiss then came in and went down to a return, giving me a third win and the r/pokemon VGC title!
Thanks for reading! I really enjoyed playing in this tournament and it was really well run. I got to watch and play against a lot of great battlers.

To those who qualify, I will be responding to you with your Assignments. If you qualified in the old thread (many of you did), I have already prepared your Assignment, but because I want everything in one place I ask that you leave a comment here as well. If I don't hear from you, I'll badger you with a PM.

To submit your design, all you need to do is PM it to me. Nothing you submit is 'official' until you say it is, or the deadline passes, at which time the most-recent image you messaged me will become your official entry. I will be as available as possible to bounce ideas off of, to take questions, to accept bribes and generally help out.
EDIT - A few Designers have expressed a desire to draw their Pokemon from multiple angles / in various positions. That's fine!
EDIT 2 - I have changed Object #59 from Teddy Bear to Stuffed Animal, to decrease the headache of trying to use it. BIG DEAL I KNOW.
But once you receive your Assignment, the clock starts. As Director, I am far too busy to bother with tardiness!
Let's do this!

9290	"[spoilers] My problem with the anime"	"7"	"35"	"20150831"	"Opperdwurg[We are proud]"	"So in the last 2/3 years I watched alot of Pokemon. I loved the first season, due to nostalgia. The whole Johta saga felt a little lame, but I also enjoyed some of that. Hoenn was great. And then came D/P... and D/P was so good. It had character devolpment, tense battles, Infernape. Ash grew up and became smarter. I thought for sure that he would became the champion after finally defeating Paul. But oh well, some random guy with a Darkrai and Latias/Latios and god knows what more legendary's.
But then... then b/w or Best Wishes came and Ash was back to zero. He just is the same kid as at the very beginning of the anime. And he is 10 years old again and he became smaller? I think this really sucks and the only reason I keep watching is because I heard X/Y is decent. 
Oh well, I just wanted that of my mind. Maybe I forgot some details, but I think I made my point. Sorry for the bad English, it's not my first language.

9295	"Pokemon Symphonic Evolution Montreal"	"3"	"11"	"20150831"	"Cylon_Toast"	"So today (yesterday the 30th) I went to see the Pokemon symphony in Montreal. The music itself was amazing and super nostalgic. Before that though I looked up other people's experiences. Compared to theirs mine was kinda dissapointing. 
So I got there and had some time to kill so I started looking at the merch. All there was was a black t-shirt with only Pikachu (who I am extremely bored of) on it and the name of the concerts, and two posters. I had read online that other places had plushies and a different shirt option. I had also been looking forward to the pokemon themed menu, nope none of that either. 
Then came the actual symphony, which to reiterate was awesome. Though the pokemon center theme after the intermission was a bit too freestyle for my liking, it took me a while to figure out what they were playing even though I've heard that jingle about a hundred times in all the games. 
Then the encore, which I had guessed was the pokemon theme, I was super psyched for that. But apparently other locations had a vocalist, we did not, it is kinda hard to sing along to something when there are no words to sing along to. It might have been easier if they made it kareoke style like the second encore.
All in all though I definately enjoyed it! Did you go? What city were you in? What were your thoughts?

Mega Pidgeot was Introduced In ORAS, But the Intriguing Stone (The item that actually is the Pidgeotite) was Introduced in XY, So my theory is that Mega Pidgeot was Considered for XY
So here's my Parts of Evidence:
-Mega Pidgeot must've been considered for XY Between The Common Stone's Cut from the Game and Release
-XY hints that the Intriguing Stone is a Mega Stone, While ORAS Confirms it's the Pidgeotite.
-Mega Flygon isn't Real yet because they can't think of a design
So here's My theory Put together:
Mega Pidgeot was considered for XY, Cutting the Common Stone (But not Removing it) from the game, but they couldn't think of a Design, Shelving Mega Pidgeot
I think I also figured out how we'll get the Pidgeotite in Pokemon Z:
After you get Lucario, you can give the Hiker In Shalour City the Intriguing Stone, after Beating the game, you can come back to the Hiker, who tells you that It's the Pidgeotite (But you'll need a Pidgeot in your team)

  Ash got him as a pikachu, so maybe when he was a pichu he had a different owner. The owner had to be a good one to get pichu to evolve, so why would professor oak be giving ash a pikachu unless something happened to its previous owner as a pichu? 
  Maybe the previous owner simply abandoned pikachu, and that would explain why he didn't like ash at first, because he had trust issues. But it doesn't explain why he refuses to go into the pokeball. Since his previous owner was good enough to pichu to get him to evolve, we can rule out abuse. It's doubtful that he would leave pikachu inside the ball for extended periods of time. 
  Maybe something happened to the original trainer, like he was ambushed on a mountainside and his pokeball containing pikachu fell down the mountain into a river and carried him downstream. Maybe the ball ended covered up by mud, which would have made it hard for pikachu to escape since electric types are weak to ground. Maybe he was stuck like this for years and years, and when he was finally found and given to professor oak, he was completely traumatized by the experience and that's why he refuses to go inside the pokeball.
  Let me know what you think, everyone. Does it sound feasible? Or am I talking nonsense?

As for the Zygarde forms - not really digging them. The designs are incredibly inconsistent and make very little logical sense to me. Were it to start as a small cell and progressively grow into the ""snake"" form we saw in XY, and then onward towards a huge serpent or whatever - okay I can deal. But a cell.... Then a dog.... Then a giant robot thing? Huh? I don't really know about all of that. 
As for Greninja - is it just speculation or is it for sure a fusion with Ash? What? Fusions? Really? I hope they aren't headed down that road. Mega-evolution was neat but honestly took me a while to get used to. Now there is a possibility for fusing with your Pokemon? That just feels very ""digimon"" to me, and not even the good bits of digimon, but the bad seasons where they fused with their monsters, too. Yikes. Not a fan.

9420	"Theory about Zinnia's people"	"7"	"25"	"20151102"	"Zappuel_LightninRod"	"So, after having a recent dream where Zinnia and Cynthia were having adventures together (It was weird dream, don't ask) I got around to thinking about a couple of ideas surrounding it, and the future of Zinnia. For the record, yes, I am one of those people who thinks we'll be seeing Zinnia in future games.Although, I think that, aside from maybe Z, she's only going to appear in remakes. And I'll explain why in a bit. First off, let's get a little bit into Zinnia's people, the Draconids.
The Draconids are a group of people who worship Rayqayza after it saved the world from Groudon and Kyogre, and the meteorite.They're very centered around Dragon type pokemon, and Rayqayza However, there is a question that I have regarding this. For being a race of people who are very close to Dragon pokemon, why is Hoenn the first we've seen of them?
With Johto having an entire city with two highly revered dragon masters hailing from it, or Sinnoh's myths involving dragons that center around Time and space, or Unova with both ideas integrated into it (Opelucid city and the Tao trio) along with having the most dragons introduced of its region, surely introducing the people in at least a future remake would make more sense, right?
However, it could also be precisely that reason why the people, and by extension, Zinnia, were introduced in OR/.AS. While the timeline is a little bit jumbled up, the tales of both Hoenn and Kanto take place at the same time, with both Sinnoh and Johto taking place three years after that, and Unova taking place a few years after that even. Hoenn is also the first time the series played with the idea of a legendary Dragon. An idea that still continues to this day.
But it still seems like a bit of a dumb move to play this card now when it could fit better with Sinnoh or Unova. Even if Hoenn was the first, this idea could work a little bit better later on. Unless...
The Draconid people are all over the Pokemon world.
Think about it. What if these people are actually all over the Pokemon world? Perhaps new characters of these people will appear in future installments... or perhaps old characters will be revealed to be descendants of these people. Perhaps Cynthia is a Draconid herself, and that's one of the reasons she knows so much about Dialga, Palkia and Giratina. Or maybe Cyrus is one instead. Or both. The twin brothers of Unovian legend are probably of their kind as well. Perhaps N is as well, and he doesn't even know it. Or maybe he isn't and thinks he is because Ghetsis is a descendant of these people (Or he lies about it). 
Maybe this is one of the things that Zinnia would reveal in her travels to other regions, and perhaps her reasons for traveling. Her people might not just be limited to Hoenn, but might expand across the whole world.

You don't necessarily have to train the one you get from Wonder Trade, just that you have to train one in general so if you wanna get the hidden ability or whatever you can. Also, if you get a Pokemon that you already have a competitively trained version of then you have to Wonder Trade it back until you get one you don't have competitively. The Pokemon I ended up getting that I'll have to train are Vespiquen, Shiftry, Pelipper, Cloyster, Whimsicott and Eevee. 
I'm not sure what I want to make the Eevee in to. I already have a competitive Espeon so we decided I can train any of it's other forms. I was thinking either Sylveon or Umbreon. Although maybe Jolteon would be best since I have no other electric types on my team.
Anyways, just a fun game if anyone else wants to try it out. My friend and I also aren't telling each other the 6 Pokemon we get so it'll be a surprise when we battle. :)

Anyway, so of course you have to catch one in the wild first before you can DexNav it. The first one I catch? Female, Poison Point, and Modest.
I was very excited. I checked its IVs online and.. well they were pretty bad. I figured well its only in-game so it being Modest should be enough. But I thought hey why not just use the DexNav see what I can find.
First one i find is: level 24 (the ones in the area are only level 14), Female,  Poison Point, Modest and... 31 IVs in Defense, Sp. Atk, and Sp. Def and really high in HP Atk and Spd.
2 Roselia's in a row were female with poison point and modest, that alone to me is lucky. But the fact that the second one was at a level as the same as my current team and perfect IVs? Arceus was looking out for me!
Sorry for the long story. What are your lucky encounters?

For the sake of this post, that means that you raise pokemon on the side while still going to school/work, you may have seen a picture of a legendary pokemon, and may even have seen one fighting on tv, but chances are you don't own one, and shiny pokemon typically belong to zoos and millionaires.  Also, just for the fun of it, let's say that you didn't get a starter pokemon as your starter and give some other 'mons a little love :)  And to make it a little more interesting, don't worry too much about only having pokemon from a specific region.  If you live in the french alps, you probably don't have a lumineon unless you caught it on vacation, but you could easily have a beartic even though those are supposedly nova exclusive.

While I do think that it was lame the way that they transitioned her from wunderkind to wild-child, I think that she had some of the best character development among Ash's traveling companions (probably second only to Brock or May). Obviously her "" You're such a kid"" was an annoying line, but other than that she was a great character because she was kind of a shitty trainer, who would obviously need to improve by leaps and bounds to be a Dragon Master. Along with the that, it can't be overlooked that even though the anime version of Iris was different from the game version, no one could really get past the fact that she is the only one of Ash's companions to be the champion in one version or another. Coupled with the fact that she didn't cop out and do contests like most other girls, I think there is something to be said for her being Ash's best female travleing companion.
Now go, my friends. Let the hate flow through you.

Similarities:

they're both big birds (fearows are nearly 4-feet-tall and weigh a little over 80 lbs., zapdos is a little over 5-feet-tall and weighs about 115 lbs.)
they both have long, sharp beaks and are often associated with the move Drill Peck
they both have angry eyes and ruffled, ""spiky"" feathers.  Spearows look more like zapdos in this regard, especially in terms of their faces
as of now (since the official art has changed) they both have the same number of toes on each foot (three in the in the front, one in the back)
they both have different-colored feathers starting on their backs and extending across the back of their wings: fearow, zapdos

If anyone else is interested let me know and i will be creating a google doc for users Pokemon, and who they will be facing in the coming weeks, it will be up to  you and your opponent to sceduall a battle time and battle during that week, and if you are not able to battle in that week you both will receive a half a point. once all battles are over (so when everyone has battled everyone) we will have a a final with the top 4 teams who battle it out until we have a winner.
We will be using the UCL Draft style because i believe it to be easier to understand and easier to do over reddit, if you don't understand what that is look at my previous post here: https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/3s3dbr/who_would_be_interested_in_a_pokemon_draft/ 
So to expedite this process i will run the draft picks for all tiers simultaneously, but first leave your name and you team coluor and tomorrow i will create a open google doc and randomize the order of picks and the draft will begin!
My name is Bill and My Team coluor is dark blue!
EDIT here is a google doc, where all the info will be: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_s7m5o5yaztaHrLCw_KjJZMxCLfovmNCYfZSASzRT_E/edit?usp=sharing

Edit* I thought I should explain what a Pokemon Draft is basically a group of people get put in a random order and in order they all pick Pokemon from the OU tier then once you reach the end of the list you go backwards (so the person who picked last picks again) you repeat this process until every one has three Pokemon from that tier, you then re randomize the order of picks and repeat for the UU, RU and NU tiers. then every week or 2 weeks you make a team with you 12 Pokemon to face your opponents team of 12, of corse you know what Pokemon they could bring so you chose the 6 Pokemon that help you the most. after everyone has battle everybody else you go in to finals with the top 4 teams and battle again. every team can only have 1 mega and mega Metagross would be banned.

For the record I'm counting a physical appearance in an episode to be their last appearance, not something like a flashback or appearing in a Japanese opening/ending theme...since those don't really count as a character actually appearing in an episode. I'll start with the oldest first:

Misty: AG134, ""A real Cleffa hanger"" aired back in 2005
Tracey: AG191 in 2006, Tracey was in the last AG episode at Pallet Town. He is briefly seen on the phone in the first DP episode too. After that he never appeared again not even when Ash returned to Pallet.
May: DP79 in 2008. The Wallace Cup was her final appearace.
Max: AG191 was his last speaking role in 2006, although he was shown watching the Wallace Cup on TV.
Gary: The Team Galactic finale in 2009. He hasn't appeared since the later half of DP.
Dawn: Best Wishes cameo in 2012. Dawn's cameo was of course her final appearance.
Brock: DP191 was his last appearance in a main series episode in 2010, but he also appeared in a Cilan special that aired in 2011 after BW ended.
Paul: DP191 was his final episode in 2010.
Iris/Cilan:  They both got specials after BW ended, if anyone cares.

As you can see with the exception of some of the more recent characters, the older characters haven't appeared in ages. Some for a decade (Misty and Tracey), and others for a really long time (May and Gary). And its bound to happen to the rest as well.

For the openings, my favourites are Advance Adventure: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4VFrrvmMFE&index=1&list=PLC49B29213D488D53 and Battle Frontier: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVYMnpbTBDo&list=PLC49B29213D488D53&index=26 Advance Adventure is a fan favourite because we had an instrumental version of the song in the sub, which is really cool! For the endings, I will go with Smile and Glory who are probably my favourites Openings/Endings of the whole anime! : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xL3O2A3Cd1E&index=12&list=PLC49B29213D488D53 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=huM05LSFc2Q&index=19&list=PLC49B29213D488D53 For the other gens, I will go with the last opening of DPPt: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-JJolVoL5E&list=PL848F191C069D6479&index=29 Those two openings of GSC are also really good, OK! and Ready Go!, OK! is probably the most known japanese opening for the people who grew up the dub as the famous battle between Ash and Gary use an intrumental version of it! : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6xVdR0h8pQ&list=PL5223039CF93982C2&index=11 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqCD-k_2vwU&list=PL5223039CF93982C2&index=18 I also really like this ending fron GSC: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHI3h7NeSc&index=50&list=PL5223039CF93982C2 That's it!

I love Latias but have never ever owned one, so I'm breaking my ""no playing with legendaries"" rule and giving her a permanent spot :') but by doing so, I've thrown off the balance of my team a bit. My team before Latias was:
-Blaziken
-Swablu 
-Metang
-Roselia
-Azumarill
-Manectric
I was getting bored of Metang and it was taking forever to evolve, so Latias will take its place. However, once Swablu evolves I will have 2 dragons. Luckily fairy types aren't common in ORAS, or not like they are in XY. BUT, I really want a dark type on my team. If I teach Latias Fly, combined with Blaziken I will have no need for an actual flying type. So I'm considering getting rid of Swablu altogether and replacing it with maybe absol. Is absol good? What are other good darks in ORAS? Conversely, I could switch out Azumarill for Crawdaunt whom I've heard is awesome, but then I have no fairy at all unless I mega evolve Altaria (and I will probably want to use mega evolutions on other pokemon) and dragons are much more common. I certainly need to do something to switch up my team and I know there's some weakness my team has that I'm not thinking of. What pokemon should I switch out and for what? I'm totally up for wildcard suggestions as well.

9517	"If Mega Sableye retains Prankster on the turn it mega evolves, does that mean that Banette won't have Prankster on the turn it mega evolves?"	"2"	"6"	"20150301"	"Shaka1277"	"I was figting a Emboar on Battle Spot earlier (base speed 65) using my Sableye (base speed 50) and on the first turn I mega evolved and yet Recover went first. I was expecting Emboar to outspeed since both regular and Mega Sableye are outsped, but that's not what happened. The only thing I can assume then is that Sableye retained Prankster in that turn and was able to move first as a result of that. 
So my question is this: Since speed is preserved in the turn of mega evolving, which of these is correct?

Prankster put Sableye's Recover into a higher priority bracket on that turn, so when it Mega Evolved and took Magic Bounce as its ability, it was still in a higher priority bracket and went first. In this case, Mega Banette would have Prankster in the first turn but wouldn't move first as its moves would be in the +0 priority bracket.
Prankster, like its base speed of 50, stayed with Sableye for that turn. In this case, Mega Banette would retain one of its three non-mega abilities for that turn, and definitely not go first. 

So, which is it?

Little boy hit Hiroshima on Aug 6. (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_bombings_of_Hiroshima_and_Nagasaki)
Also, Fuji states that the purpose of his project was to clone Mew, which he mentions as the most powerful pokemon in the world, similar to how nuclear energy is considered the most powerful energy source in the world. 
Other parallels:
-Mew is the predecessor of all pokemon and similarly, the sun can be seen as the ""parent"" that made life possible. The sun runs on nuclear fission
-Fuji mentions that he tried to clone is daughter before and was met with disgust from his wife. Despite this, he continued in his mad pursuit of a scientific solution to his grief. Baconian/Frankenstein/Modernistic promethean urge, anyone? That's a clear message of the moral limits of science.
-The clone of Fuji's daughter dies, symbolizing the disillusioning influences the bomb had on Japan 
-Many survivors of the bomb were treated with a level of contempt as people ""marked"" by the bomb, similar to Mewtwo's human/pokemon identity crisis

I've just spent an hour of my life playing this ROM hack called Pokemon Snakewood, trying to get through ONE boss battle, and all I got out of it was a healthy sense of rage at the sheer pointlessness of life. 
Backstory. In the game there's this group of crazy (literally) villains called the Deadly Seven, even though there are actually ten of them because of some weird attempt at humor, and when you get the Lilycove city the game makes you fight all ten of them. In a row. 
That's not the fucking end of things though. Snakewood has a few fakemon, most of which are admittedly pretty cool, except for this fucking Flying/Fighting thing called a Kenchukuo. Kenchukuo would probably be banned from Uber if it was an actual Pokemon. It has 88/160/85/17/85/165 stats. To put that in context, it has higher attack than Groudon and is faster than Ninjask, and its defenses are just good enough that it won't be one-shotted. It's ridiculous. That's not more. Its ability is Speed Boost. Fucking Speed Boost. Did I mention it also gets access to Belly Drum? Can you imagine a 4x boosted STAB Sky Uppercut coming off 165 Attack? Neither could I, until I was faced with the absolute ridiculousness that was this fakemon.
Oh yeah, and the third member of the Deadly Seven you face has two of them.
This is the last straw for me. I was okay with this game up until now. So what if they made you fight a level 51 Lugia in Fortree and a Ho-oh right after that? I'm a big kid. I can handle it. I can handle the game's endless pop culture references, weird and random dialogue, and that one fucking puzzle through a room ten times as big as Janine's maze that teleported you back to the beginning if you stepped on one wrong tile. You know what I can't handle? FUCKING THIS.
I'm out. I'm done. This game has made me angrier than I have ever been at any Pokemon game, probably more angry than I have ever been in my entire life. 
Now if someone can recommend me a good ROM hack to play, maybe that will fill the void in my soul that was taken by Snakewood.

I'd say some of the newer games are more difficult in post game with the addition of things like battle towers or the like with opponents with better ai and team builds.
People talk about high leader or e4 levels but thats not difficulty man, thats just a grind. A grind is not indicitive of difficulty.
I mean im with you guys in wanting a harder pokemon game, but higher levels isnt the way to go. There needs to be an option for hard mode that gives all leaders e4 6 pokemon and smarter ai, coupled with rounded teams with competitive movesets, items, ev ivs and natures.
As well as upping the standard trainer ai and giving them some but not all of the above.

For me my favorite is Arcanine. It has been my favorite since nearly the beginning. I was 6 when I first got Pokemon red in 1998. I like many others chose Charmander as my starter because fire breathing dragon. So I just loved fire types and was really digging Charizard. That all changed when I got to Cinnabar Island and finally battled Blaine. I was in awe the first time I saw his Arcanine. It was just the coolest thing I had ever seen looking like a part wolf, part lion, part tiger creature. 
Following the battle I immediately checked the pokedex and caught myself a growlith. Of course at this time I was clueless about which Pokemon evolve from stones so I trained that growlith to level 70 before I figure I had to try something new. One fire stone latter and I finally had my Arcanine. I was just so happy.
My love for it only grew as I saw Arcanine in different parts of Pokemon. Running with Ash in the opening sequence to the show or using him for the first time in stadium. The first time I got the original Arcanine Pokemon card I was pumped. It was the strongest card I had and looked so regal. It was just amazing to me. To this day Arcanine is my absolute favorite and a important part of my team.

Version 2.1 is live. Download link below! (note: download link doesn't change between versions, it is always up to date due to using git)
CatchCalc is a simple in Java written program that can calculate the chance of capture a pokemon given the pokemon Max HP and current HP. While a couple of steps are still required to actually know these values (one method explained below), it is wishful thinking to hope that in a future game we'll actually be able to see values rather than green bars.
?
How to find the wild pokemon's HP:
?
First and foremost I have to say this this will never be accurate due to IVs, so I greatly advice you to set the HP IV to 31 so in any case the chance of capture ends up being higher than calculated!
That said, for finding out how much HP the pokemon has that you are encountering you can use any battle simulator (i.e. Pokemon Showdown) or save editor (i.e. PKHeX).
Simply pick your pokemon, set the level and make sure the HP IV is 31. 
For the ""current HP"" you can go for a single HP, implying the use of False Swipe or Hold Back or you could take the max HP.
?
Download link:
The .jar file is on the bitbucket. Click here to download it directly.
The sourcecode is publicly available on Bitbucket, click here to go there.
?
Requirements:
Like I said, the program has been written in Java. Most modern machines come with Java pre-installed, but otherwise you can download the Java Runtime Environment 
?
FAQ:
Q: It doesn't start!
A: Make sure you have associated the .jar extension with Java. To do so right click the program then ""open with"" and then select the Java platform.
Q: I can't find the Java platform in the list!
A: If you are certain that you did install the above linked JRE, also go ahead and download the Java Development Kit for your OS. Once you have that installed
?
On Windows:

Open a command prompt by holding the windows key then pressing R. This will make the Run popup show, in here type cmd.exe
In the command prompt type cd [path-to-where-you-saved-the-program] and hit enter
Then type Java -jar ""CatchCalc.jar"" including quotation marks!

On Mac (At least this worked for me on my OSX Maverics, I don't use my Mac a lot. at all)

Open Terminal
Type Java -jar ""CatchCalc.jar"" including quotation marks!

On Linux (going by Ubuntu here, not sure if it's the same across all distributions)

Open Terminal
navigate to the folder where the program is, if this is the Downloads folder it will most likely be by typing cd ~/Downloads
Type Java -jar ""CatchCalc.jar"" including quotation marks!

Changelog:
(- for removed, + for added, @ for changed)
?
Version 2.1:

@ Corrected some spelling mistakes
@ Did some code refactoring
+ Updated catch rate calculation so it also allows for selecting either XY or ORAS

?
Version 2.0:

- The old code
+ Completely rewritten from ground up - Switched from the GUI editor in NetBeans to standard classes.
+ A repo on bitbucket
@ An actually working distributable file. I was not aware that the previous download was accidentally missing files, but this time around it's all packed in 1 .jar file.

Version 1.0:

Initial release

It took me about a week, but I finally have a Galvantula with 5 IVs, A Good nature, Compound eyes, 252 Sp. Attack EVs, 252 speed EVs and 4 HP EVs. 
It's so satisfying to battle with him, and I feel great! 
On top of that I Wondertraded about 5 boxes of Joltiks, with decent EVs, various natures etc. and got some really cool pokemon in return!

However, that being said, I think I've got an original theory here that makes a lot of sense to my friends and I. If you've seen something along these lines before, I welcome you all to please post a link or just discuss it. But, I digress.
So a couple of my buddies and I hit an urge for nostalgia one day and decided to watch the first Pokemon movie, the one with Mewtwo and Mew. Everything was awesome, we've played the games since the 90's, and even though we never really kept up with the modern show we can still go back and watch the stuff from Kanto and Johto whenever due to the good memories. (I'll add here we were pretty stoned.) So we watch the entire movie, and at the end, during the fight between Mew and Mewtwo, they attack eachother and Ash runs in front of them and turns to stone. Previously in the movie someone mentioned Pokemon tears containing light, and curative properties. As I'm sure you guys know, the Pokemon and clones alike cry for Ash and their tears reverse the petrification process and everything's all good. But is it? I had an epiphany and started thinking... What if that's the reason that Ash never ages? He's eternally 10 years old because his aging was stopped by being restored to life by Pokemon tears, which is why he's always going to new regions with new companions and the old members of the crew are rarely or never mentioned... Because their all dead. There are all new Pokemon not because of different regions but because the species is constantly adapting and dare I say it.... Evolving. (pun intended)
Anyhow, I thought it was pretty crazy and just thought I'd share it with you fellow redditors and Pokemon enthusiasts.
Let me know what you guys think!

There, you can observe the behavior of pokemon to classify their type and other observable traits.

For me, at least, there are three that readily come to mind - the legendary genies. They're just so horrifically ugly and far too similar in incarnate forms that I feel that they need a re-design. I'm not sure how I'd re-design them, though. 
a minor thing, delphox could probably have a little bit of a look-over and minor editing in the design, maybe with less earfluff, and slightly shorter ears. I still quite like Delphox, though.

"Looking for some input from my fellow /r/pokemon trainers here to come up with an idea to elaborate on a pokemon themed christmas present for my GF. Just a bit of warning I am going for something a bit sappy :P.
Background Story Time
A few weeks ago I walked into my bedroom and announced ""A wild Jessica appears!"" as she was laying on the bed waiting for me. She laughs and when I get onto the bed she says ""Jessica uses headbutt!"" and playfully headbutts me in the stomach. Now I cannot remember exactly what I said, but I said something along the lines of ""If you were a pokemon I would use my masterball on you"", it was a bit more elaborate than that but that is the idea. Yes it is corny and sappy but she went crazy over it, and she was very touched and emotional and thought it was extremely sweet.
Fast Forward to Present Day
That got me thinking about a way to turn this meaningful exchange into a thoughtful present of some sort. I found on etsy a store which makes authentic style Pokeballs, and I ordered one done in the style of a Masterball. It just arrived a couple of days ago. Smaller than I expected and I need a battery for the lights. Just giving her a Masterball isn't going to have the impact I am going for.
Link to the gift I purchased (not advertising, just so everyone knows what this gift revolves around).
I am trying to think up how I can jazz this up to be extra special. The Masterball does open up, although there isn't to much space to put something in there. I also bought a case for it as well which the ball sits inside of.
I was thinking of writing a poem and putting it in the case somewhere, maybe make a super small HTML5 game, recreating an outdoor field where you can encounter a random pokemon and have some sort of corny dialogue or something. Another option if I can't think of anything was just to bundle it with a 3ds and a copy of X or Y, but I would like to think of something fun and romantic if I could.
Anyone have any other ideas?

Hell, the first episode of the show featured Ho-oh as an important sighting by Ash. You'd think he would actually find one. I would think the lore behind Ho-oh would be interesting enough to make a movie for. It could even feature Raikou who I don't think has been in a movie either.

I'm looking for someone to do this challenge with me. For those who don't know, Nuzlocke is a harder way of playing Pokemon. Here's the basic rules:
-You can only catch the first Pokemon in each area. If you kill it or it flees, there are no do-overs. You also can't save before you enter an area, then keep reloading your game until you find a Pokemon you want. -You must nickname all Pokemon to create a better bond with your Pokemon. -If a Pokemon faints, you must either release it or put it in the PC, never to be used in this playthrough again.
The extra Soul Link rules change the challenge a little, and are as follows:
-Each Pokemon you catch in an area is linked with the Pokemon your partner(s) catch. If one of those Pokemon is boxed, so are the ones that are linked with it. Simultaneously, if a Pokemon 'dies', any Pokemon it is linked with also 'dies'. -[OPTIONAL] Players cannot have more than one Pokemon with a first type in the total of all parties. So, you can have Bulbasaur (Grass/Poison) and Koffing (Poison), but not Bulbasaur and Sunkern (Grass)

Least needed: All legendary megas except for Diancie. Really, legendaries are powerful enough already. They don't need higher stats. The reason I made an exception for Mega Diancie is because it allows you to use Diancie in a different way (offensively as opposed to defensively), making it more of a traditional forme change.
tl;dr: Worst: Audino, Least needed: all legendaries except for Diancie.

9659	"Would you play a Pokemon themed Munchkin set?"	"24"	"8"	"20151228"	"pandajedi"	"Munchkin is a card game that simulates rpg dungeon crawling, but made simple and fun. I play it a lot with my family, and there are many expansions and alternate versions, some of which use licensed properties like Adventure Time or Axe Cop. 
I was thinking that a Pokemon variant would fit really well. If you're familiar with Munchkin, the Pokemon version would be similar but with some changes. In this version, rather than build up a single character with equipment and use their strength to fight, you instead use Pokemon to fight. The monsters that you encounter can be captured to join your party (a 6 card maximum) or defeated to level up (reaching 10 being the end goal). Filling out your party and replacing them with stronger Pokemon increases your chances of defeating stronger 'mons and therefore getting more rewards. 
You also could give your trainer a class and some equipment to change his or her abilities. Classes would be like Trainer, Breeder, Ranger, etc. Each Pokemon would probably have their own ability too, but to keep it balanced you maybe could only have one Pokemon at the lead of your party at a time, so you can only access that ability and your own, rather than yours and 6 others at once. 
Every Pokemon could have a held item, which allows you to further expand your skills and strengths, but of course in classic Munchkin fashion, there'd be plenty of curses and abilities that let you screw up the other players, like making them lose items or even stealing their Pokemon.

"2"	"2"	"20160104"	"Eiskalt89vileplume"	"Does anyone else feel like there really needs to be an eventual rebalancing of the type chart and ability allocation? It feels like every season this gets to be a worse and worse problem with certain types (aside from say one exception mon) feel downright useless while other types are simply too hard to effectively check.
Fairy, Poison, Rock, Ice, Bug, and Water are big examples of this in different ways. Fairy vs Poison as a first big point in that Poison Pokemon tend to stay pretty lackluster and the bulk of their moves being special based, which Fairies tend to have a high resistance too with their type trait of having higher special defense. This means effective poison types have to be extremely strong wallbreaker style like mega Gengar or rely on things like Poison Jab which tends to end up being better as a TM move than on actual Poison type Pokemon thanks to their generally low stats and low average Attack stat as a whole. 
Ice types have a similar problem where their typing is so piss poor defensively that only ones like Weavile (for speed) tend to be decent at any point with Ice being better as a TM coverage option than to bring an actual Ice type Pokemon.
Could go on for the other types but in short, some types feel better to have as TM/tutor coverage moves than to bring the actual type of Pokemon to use them while others, like Water, have such a narrow amount of effective weaknesses that certain Pokemon remain very difficult to check.

Essentially a mix of real world Japanese idol's and beauty pagents performing with their pokemon. Serena's entire goal is to make herself look as beautiful as possible, perform on stage to get as many votes from the audience as possible, and to do Contest-like appeals with her pokemon. Her competition is girls only, which makes it even more obvious its an idol competition. 
Her other role of course is her huge crush on Ash, which is actually the most blatant shipping subplot the writers had done. So Serena wants to be Ash's waifu, as well as be a beautiful idol performer.
Is this a representation of current Japanese culture? Where women are expected to be wives of men and to perform idol like beauty? They pretty much started this to a lesser extent with Dawn, but since Dawn still battled in Contests and she didn't have an obsessed crush on Ash, it was a little less blatant.
Its kind of funny we went from the tomboyish Misty, to the more neutral May, to more excessively girly female leads who want to look as beautiful as possible. That's Japan for you.

I would also welcome a return to Japan, since it's what the devs know best and they wouldn't have to travel all over the world for research like they did with Kalos. Also, Johto is my favorite region, so there's my bias.

So I was contemplating how awesome that this series is still going after two decades (some of you may not see this as a good thing, but again, whatever) and it occurred to me that if we're getting a game this year it's gonna be pretty spectacular.
Most speculation says Pokemon Z and this is most probable but I think it could be possible that we're finally going to see a 3D Kanto region, the Pokemon Company sending us back to their roots. It could be part of Z, maybe all the Kanto Pokemon and an appearance of Oak (might finally get to fight him), for that Anniversary feel but I think this might be the direction they might head. And the next remake can't be Sinoh, it just feels too soon and besides, we've had the Gen 3 remake maybe we'll get a Fire Red/Leaf Green remake.
I don't know, just speculating but want do you think? Are we getting something special this year?

QUESTION I was just wondering. What would the best approach when we get to the top 10? Continue with this?, maybe do a tourney bracket? Or maybe have all 10 Pokemon against each other in one fight? Those are just 3 I have in mind. Please if you have any thoughts or ideas I would love to hear them. Thank you :)

Previously, the longest time Ash has gone without a full team of 6 has been in Hoenn, where he caught his Snorunt in AG108.
Interesting that this is a new record for the anime.
On the road to the Kalos Pokemon League, there's still his final badge (maybe Wulfric, maybe a new gym if Z has any, like the AG and BW series had), the whole Team Flare debacle and whatever the hell Serena's doing beforehand, so he may well catch another Pokemon before this series is out!

"This VGC season has been subject to a cascades of criticism, with the prevalence of Dark Void and Primals arguably centralizing the game even more than CHALK did in 2015. There's really no incentive to play in any way except set-up-and-sweep. So, I just speculated some rules, additions, and bans that could help out the meta once Pokemon Z comes around.

Pokemon Z Only. All battles will be Double Battles played in Pokemon Z.
Time Limit. Time limits for battles will vary by event. At major events (Regional Championships and above), battles will have a 15-minute time limit, 45-second move timer, and a 90-second Team Preview.
2 Major Legendary Pokemon per Team. Teams may have no more than two of the following Legendary Pokemon: Mewtwo, Lugia, Ho-Oh, Kyogre, Groudon, Rayquaza, Deoxys, Dialga, Palkia, Giratina, Darkrai, Reshiram, Zekrom, Kyurem, Xerneas, Yveltal, and Zygarde.
1 Mythical Pokemon per Team. Teams may have no more than one of the following Mythical Pokemon: Mew, Celebi, Jirachi, Phione, Manaphy, Shaymin, Victini, Keldeo, Meloetta, Genesect, Diancie, and Hoopa.
Blue Pentagon Clause and Exceptions. Pokemon brought in via Poke Transporter will not be permitted, except for the above listed Legendary and Mythical Pokemon. All other Pokemon must be marked by a blue pentagon.
Pokemon Bans. Teams may not use the following Pokemon: Arceus, Perfect Forme Zygarde.
Item Clause and Bans. All items will be allowed except Red Orb, Blue Orb and Soul Dew. Each Pokemon must hold a different item.
Move Bans. All moves will be allowed except the following: Dark Void, Spore, Geomancy, Hyperspace Hole, Hyperspace Fury.
Nickname Clause. Nicknames are now permitted but nicknames containing profanity are not allowed.

What do you think? Would you change VGC in any way?

Type: Bug/Poison
Ability: Speed Boost
HP: 60
Attack: 165 (+65)
Defense: 100 (+11)
Sp. Attack: 55
Sp. Defense: 90 (+21)
Speed: 115 (+3)
Okay, obviously M-Scolipede has a bit of a disadvantage to M-Blaziken because he's Physical-based rather than a mixed attacker, and the obvious type disadvantage.
However, M-Scolipede has better stats than Mega Blaziken in all areas other than HP and Special Attack. It always outspeeds Mega Blaziken and has basically the same set-up moves. It also 4x resists one of M-Blaziken's two attacking types, meaning Power-Up Punch is kind of out of the question. It also has access to Earthquake, which coming off of 165 attack against M-Blaziken's 80 HP/Defense, does a LOT of damage. It also has Poison Jab, which has a really nice chance of poisoning M-Blaziken. Its defenses are also pretty high, higher than Mega Blaziken, meaning it can take more hits.
So tl;dr, this Mega Scolipede is the perfect counter to Mega-Blaziken because it has more Attack, Defenses, and Speed, as well as the same setup moves and access to moves that could OHKO it. This set of stats doesn't seem too Farfetch'd and seems like something GF would do. this would be a nice break from seeing Mega Blaziken all over Ubers.

I hate to come on here and rant, but I am livid. For weeks my little brother and I have been going to our local Smyths (which is still a lengthy drive) and being told the system was down or such, fair enough, but today we went in to ask and got treated like shit. Kindly asking if we could get a redeemable code, I got a dirty look from the guy who was serving at the counter and told the system was down, and while I could normally accept being told they couldn't get us the code, his look, his tone, and him not even attempting to check rubbed me the wrong way, we had words and it ended up with me having to walk my little brother out of the store, who was deeply upset by the whole issue.
I get that stores can be busy, and that some people can't handle stressful days working in retail(I've had my own share of busy times working in retail too), but if you're going to work at a kids toy store, being a prick to kids is just not on...
Can anyone help, please? At this point, I'm not worried about missing out on Rayquaza, but I'm hurting for my little brother. 
Sorry to rant, but thanks. 
-PokemontrainerKai
Edit
A big thank you to /u/sarahn113 for helping my little brother get his hands on his favourite Pokemon. You're a wee gem! :D

Problem is I haven't played Pokemon since gold/silver over a decade ago, and there have been many many new games and generations since then (I read somewhere that there are now nearly 800 Pokemon to catch?!) and trying to figure out where to jump back in is rather overwhelming.
I've considered buying black/white because apparently these only have 150ish Pokemon and they are all new and unrelated to previous games, but I've also heard that the online parts are no longer supported so I'll miss out on a lot of what the game has to offer.
I've also read up on heart gold/soul silver, however these seem to be very hard to find and expensive and are now rather old compared to what has come since.
I've decided to wait for Pokemon z to be released and skip out on x and y, but alpha/omega seems to be a remake of an earlier game that I haven't played and I'm confused by all the new additions to the Pokemon formula I'm familiar with (mega evolutions etc). However this is the most recent game series and the online community still exists, so this is probably a good option.
Tl;dr - I want to play Pokemon for the first time in over a decade, which game should I buy for my 3ds.
Update:- I decided to buy Omega Red and wait for Z to release next year. I also picked up a used copy of White that was in stock, so I'll have fun playing through those.    Thanks for the feedback, I'm really looking forward to catching 'em all again!

"0"	"19"	"20151026"	"Big_YazzaTerra Nullius Dev"	"Unfortunately, this can only be achieved through hacking, but the fact still remains that it's literally invincible. So, what you need to do is catch a Shedinja. Then, hack it so that it has the ability Sturdy. This is quite common, I'm surprised no-one has taken it further. Sturdy Shedinja can be beaten by Poison, Burn, Confusion, Entry Hazards, Weather and Recoil Damage. That's it. By hacking Ingrain onto it, and sending it in first, you eliminate Entry Hazards. But here's the real kicker: You paralyse it before battle. Yes, you get the cons of paralysis, but you also get the pros of only taking damage from Hail and Sandstorm. And if it's holding Safety Goggles... Invincible. Shame it can't be used on Showdown, as pokemon start out healthy.
EDIT: Oh, and give it Gastro Acid to prevent Mold Breakers from bypassing Sturdy.

I know that there have been loooots of threads discussing which feature would you like to see in the GTS and so and so but I was just thinking (a showerthought) of a fusion between the GTS and the normal trade.
What if we would be able to send pokemon to a friend when they are not connected and once they connect they get a message like, your friend sent you this pokemon, sent him some poke to complete the trade or dismiss the trade. Something like that could people like me, who loves to send and get pokes from people in reddit but because I live in GMT + 1 I'm not able to be connected at the same time as the redditor I'm willing to trade with.
What do you think about it? Which will be other features regarding trades that you'll like to see or you think may help?

9883	"Pokemon Z and the Locked Power Plant"	"39"	"38"	"20151130"	"shawdee3I name them all steve"	"So during Pokemon XY, we had to defeat team flair in the power plant, in which we turned it back on to help re-enable Lumiouse city's power supply. However, if you explored the Badlands (as painful as that is to do), you find locked doors that lead to different areas. When the games first came out, I assumed that they were either post game things or something to do with the leaking of Volcanion. However, as time has progressed they have pointed towards different things given how the Pokemon company have distributed the different legends (namely Hoopa and Diancie). With this being done, I think Nintendo changed the plans for these doors and have set back whatever they were originally planning on doing until Pokemon Z.
With this said, it could also be related to the delayed/scrapped Mega Flygon as this is also the area in which Trapinch is exclusively found. With that aside, what else could it be? We have two ideas we know about (Volcanion and M Flygon) with our first relating to two of the three doors; the ""fire"" door and the ""water"" door. Many dismissed this after ORAS was announced as the three doors symbolisied the three key legends of those games. I for one think it has greater meaning than foreshadowing a remake. I think these doors each lead to a new area in Kalos with each being based around the door type in which they are surrounded. This would help to give Kalos a much-needed boost of interest as besides the new region effect that it had, it was an overall bland and linear region linking back to the third town/city for the 5th gym (sound familiar?). 
Now with that part aside, we could talk about the potential insides of these doors, the fire one, could perhaps be Entei, the water one Suicune. But that leaves the ""wind"" one and a Raikou not involved. Unless it is already obtained by said trainer. The original door that we go through could get an entire makeover, with the door initially being a power plant but leading to the area in which we get a gift-legendary such as Raikou with (you guessed it) a Raikouite for a trio of mega evolving legendaries. 
Now all this leaves one door remaining. The ""wind"" door. Unlike the others, I do not feel like this door will be related to legendary pokemon; at least, not initially. I think that the door will lead into a new part of Kalos through a ""cycle"" path similar to the connecting ones in the Kanto region, bringing either a second region (the less likely) or a new city (similar to the plane-only areas of Unova). This city could again help to bring a bigger region to explore, and be one of the key reasons Z is taking longer than the last two installments. 
With this all said, if you have read through this all I commend you, and hope that you either agree or acknowledge the thought I have put into the three mysterious doors of the Badlands. If you have any thoughts on these doors or what I've said I'd really like to know, so please, please leave your opinion below, I'd love to discuss this further with poke-crazed fans akin to myself.

"24"	"7"	"20151130"	"TheAussieBritt"	"Long story short, I received an excellent Nidoran specimen from someone on /r/pokemontrades and spent some time last night training it into a godly Nidoqueen. With the training finished I headed into Battle Spot for a couple of hours. I saved a recording of a battle in which my Nidoqueen led and smashed everything.
I then closed the 3DS and went to sleep, without plugging it into the power plug. Today when I woke up and turned on the system. I resumed the game in in Jagged Pass as opposed to the Battle Resort where I'd done the BS battles and closed the game. ""This isn't right"" I wondered. Only when I opened the Pokemon menu and inspected my party I discovered I've lost several hours of play and my precious Nidoqueen is still a mere Nidoran hatchling. 
However, things got stranger when I open my Vs. Recorder to find that battle from the previous evening where my Nidoqueen stomps! So I have the video of this glorious Pokemon in action, but now do not have the Pokemon itself, only it's 'past' self!

Baby Pokemon are in the undiscovered Egg Group, meaning that they get guaranteed perfect IVs in at least 3 stats
If they're part of a three-stage evolution family, they effectively ban their second stage from Little Cup, which could be good for balancing it (imagine Chansey in Little Cup...)
They let people access Pokemon lines earlier in the games without giving them access to then-OP Pokemon (Budew for example)
They can connect Pokemon as evolutionary relatives (Tyrogue for example)
Helps with lore/world building (Elekid makes more sense to hatch from an egg than a full grown Electabuzz)
Evolutionary families feel more complete and logical (Mantine felt a bit bare, but having Mantyke and its special evolution method fleshed it out a bit)
New moves learned by them can pass on to evolutions

That being said, not all baby Pokemon are good. Igglybuff, Cleffa, and Azurill in particular were unnecessary, as their evolutions aren't exactly OP at any point in the game, and they don't bring any new moves or world building to the table. They're pretty cute though.
Examples of great babies are Munchlax, Mantyke, Elekid, and Wynaut. They're all good Pokemon in Little Cup, and expand on their evolutionary relatives in a positive way lore- and game balance-wise. More babies like that would be great in the future.
Barring Cleffa, Igglybuff, Azurill, and maybe Pichu and Bonsly, I don't see why everyone's so against babies. They're great if done right.

I win a good amount of the time, but then I run into trainers that are very good and blow me away. Most of which are Japanese players. It's gotten to the point where I feel a mix of fear and anticipation whenever the location flashes up Japan. Like the feeling of coming across a dangerous animal. 
Sometimes I get lucky and shut them down before they get started. I've cause a lot of forfeits by just using Taunt. Other times I get completely read and it's over in a flash. Outtrained, outwitted, etc. It doesn't help that I limit my team to Rock and Ground types either, but I like the challenge.
I guess what I'm asking is how you all feel when you face off against Japanese players. I don't mean to be disrespectful if it appears that way. It's quite the opposite really. Playing against them gives me new ideas and strategies to try out. But I suppose the same could be said for any player really. But even looking at the results of the last World Championship, it's quite apparent that Japan plays very differently. I wonder why that is...

First  off, we need to officially vote on the version mascot. I've narrowed it down to the 4 most voted ones that made sense with the evil teams' plots, Cresselia, Darkrai, Celebi, or Shaymin. Now that we know the evil teams' motivations, it'll be easier to make a final judgment.
Also, we need to vote on things like the level curve and the Champion's team. This survey's a little hard to explain to you, but it's still very important to the game. The link is here.
Anyone who wants to sign up to be part of the Dev team can do so here. The more devs we have, the faster the game gets released, but you have to be committed.
Please participate in the survey, and upvote this post for visibility. I get no karma from text posts, and I want as much representation as I can get from you guys! Thanks for helping!

I appreciate your points and it seems I was overstating the importance of Base stats as a measure of usefulness. For true competitive settings, like tournaments, I guess you really can't expect all Pkmn to remain doable, and you can't expect players to ignore the top tier jus because some of them might not like it.
For the video games however I still think the matchmaking system could really use some tweaks, so you can more reliably be matched against a team of similar strength. Base stats was just the same first thing that came to mind. I remember how much customisation games like Stadium 1 & 2 had, I'd love to see a return of filters like that for anyone to use!

Can someone explain to me why neither the ""official"" in-game rules, nor the simulator meta games have ever been built around Base stat caps (or at least they never seem to be)?
It always seemed so natural to me that the easiest way to get balanced teams in a tournament, while at the same time keeping the largest amount of Pkmn viable, was to limit Players to a maximum amount of Base stats on their team.
Quick example of the kind of system I mean: Find the average Base stat of all Final evolutions, multiply by 6. That gives you a certain value [max]. You can then build any team you like, as long as you do not go over that [max] threshold.
That way you can end up with a full team of mid-range Pkmn, or a mix of a few high-range and low-range. Wouldn't a system like that allow for the most diversity instead of gravitating towards a handful of popular picks that everyone copies?

I'm asking because I honestly don't see how competitive players can remain enthusiastic when they are basically always limiting themselves to a very small set of Pkmn that can actually ""make the cut"".
Every time I think of a fun strategy with Pkmn I enjoy using, they simply cannot compete with teams running six 550+ Base stat teams. And I feel that ends up being the only real difference. Even if I were to use my team perfectly, and the opponent would make mistakes, they would still be at a huge advantage just because of the Base stat difference.
This wouldn't have to affect any tournament/game specific rules, just a general rule that could apply to all of them: look at the Base stats of the non-banned Pkmn, then set a reasonable maximum amount of Base stats that players are not allowed to exceed.

Does anyone think this means that the differences between XY and the third version will be a lot bigger than usual? Though, B2W2 are really different from BW and took less than two years.

A little backstory: About 1? years I was looking at some pokemon videos. I had always played EVERY SINGLE Pokemon game, but since I did not have a 3DS I had not played X/Y. 
I wanted to change that. I wanted to buy a 3DS and play the hell out of it - There was only 1 problem: My dad. He wouldn't allow me. He said: ""It's a game for children"". This upset me quite a bit, mostly because, well, it was my money, so why was I not allowed to use it the way I wanted to?
I kept looking at this sub. I saw how fun you guys had it, and that's when it clicked: I wanted to get this. 
Present time: Yesterday I finally did it. I went out and got the 3DSXL and Pokemon without my dad knowing. When he found out he didn't say a word, but I think he's accepted it. 
Once again: I just wanted to say thank you, to every single one of you. You made me do this, you made me get this awesome game (and console). Thanks.
EDIT: So, today the weirdest thing happened. He came into my room while I was playing and said: To be fair, the new games DO look good. I think it was a good thing you but it - If it makes you happy. 
That made me really happy! :)

A new generation awaits¡K
The folks here at Edged Reality are making history by creating the very first custom ROM hack in a NDS game (Light Platinum wouldn¡¦t count- the creator has converted it from the GBA platform). 
By custom, we are referring to a totally new game- no ¡§edits¡¨ to existing ones, such as Blaze Black & Volt White (which are still very good edits, in our opinion!)
Using a base engine derived from Pokemon Platinum, Edged Reality is committed to building Pokemon Cobalt & Amethyst from scratch - from the ground up. No files are reused or taken from Pokemon Platinum - all will be wiped, and our custom ones take the stage. Purely the theoretical use of what is possible (IE- camera angles, map treatment) is used by Edged Reality.

A new, custom adventure awaits in Pokemon Cobalt & Amethyst.
Meet Cobalt: http://i.imgur.com/5BmXat3.png?2
Meet Amethyst: http://i.imgur.com/n5vixs8.png?1

With 151 new, custom Pokemon, Cobalt & Amethyst looks to differ themselves from other ROM hacks. Namely, Cobalt & Amethyst looks to completely revolutionize the very art of Pokemon games themselves, setting a new standard for the way they¡¦re played and made.
Cobalt & Amethyst will be coming to the following platforms:
-PC (as per IPS/UPS patching to a clean ROM)
-Nintendo DS (via a flashcart)
-Nintendo 3DS (via a flashcart)
-iOS
-Android
-Minecraft
Edged Reality has decided to partner with Phoenix Projects in order to bring Cobalt & Amethyst to Minecraft. Phoenix Projects is responsible for the Minecraft platform, while Edged Reality is committed to creating Cobalt & Amethyst on the other aforementioned platforms.

This thread serves as the general thread for updates regarding Pokemon Cobalt & Amethyst, as well as a general ¡§question¡¨ thread for those who are interested in the project.
If anyone wishes to apply to partake in this project, simply go to this link: https://www.reddit.com/r/PokemonROMhacks/comments/3esol8/recruit_pokemon_cobalt_amethyst_a_new_generation/

Note: For those of you who want to hate, we do have a coder. We also have an artist, as well as a 3D modeler. We have the bare minimum of what is needed to make this hack. The more people who join in, the faster this can get done.

This is the project I have been working on ,
It is a QR pokedex with all Pokemon included from gen 1 to 6 in QR form.
it also includes:
1. 6iv Dittos (all natures) Japanese Shiny ready for breeding.
2. 476 events in QR form from all over the world from gen 1 to 6.
3. Hackmons (can't be used online) but they are great fun to do the story with.
4. QR items, master balls,nuggets,mega-stones,recovery items and cloning codes.
5. Qr permanent mega evolutions of all Pokemon, competitive sets.
6. random QR sets from some pokes you may find interesting.
THE MOST EXCITING PART OF THE POKEDEX IS:
7. the wonder-cards, these you have to collect from the mystery gift lady, like the items codes they don't appear in box 1 slot 1 in your PC, there are 71 different wonder cards to choose from and they all give you the data-cards in your mystery gift section.
DISCLAIMER.
These are all tested on OR & AS.
ALL of the Pokemon from the QR Pokedex were made from Pokemon X&Y. APART from the legendaries, some were made in OR&AS and will corrupt the X&Y data.
Remember also some mega stones don't belong on X & Y.
I cannot be held responsible for you corrupting your X & Y game because I have warned that some codes do not work on X&Y.

If you like my database just a quick thanks would be nice as i spent a long time on it.

I just got mod approval to share with you all the game that I am in the process of making on Project Spark. It's a pokemon style game called Pokemon World (working title.)
Explore Pallet Town, Route 1, and Viridian City.
This is still in its early alpha stages but the core mechanics are there and in my opinion very fun to play at this point. And it's completely FREE. Here are the instructions for how to download the game. 
This game has been created using the Project Spark platform so you will need to have access to that, which is also completely free. In order to access Project Spark you need to download it on either the Xbox One or a PC running either Windows 8.1 or 10.
Download Project Spark Here!
If you download Project Spark on you PC you can follow this link and select ""Play Now"" to try out the game.
http://www.projectspark.com/#world?id=8076204&tab=info
If you downloaded it on Xbox One you will need to search for the game by it's name ""Pokemon World."" It will have the creator name of Plus 7w0, which is me.
Battle and capture the 8 available pokemon.
This is the most current version of the game that is ready for people to try out and I would love to get any feedback that I could from anyone that checks it out. I am in the process of working on an update for this game that is going to be a major overhaul and I will be sure to update when that is ready for testing as well. There is no story to the game right now, but there are 8 ""pokemon"" in the world for you all to catch and evolve!

Find it here! And a screenshot for those on mobile. Click here to make a copy for yourself.
Throughout the last few weeks I've spend many hours on crafting this spreadsheet to keep track of all my Pokemon caught. My demands are high and you'll see that in the spreadsheet. It is loosely based on this spreadsheet from /u/Zifendale. I say loosely because I stripped most information and only kept that which I thought would be necessary for a fast but enjoyable completion.
This spreadsheet aims to be a tool for people with Pokemon OR/AS, and optionally access to Pokemon X or Y. These games can almost catch every Pokemon.
Features:

Using color indication and sprites to process and go through all the data faster. I made it look appealing which I consider just as important as functionality.
Rows are green. If marked as caught the row turns grey. Green/red for the Yes/No columns for OR/AS and X/Y.
Direct links to Bulbapedia.
Dropdown menu's for all Yes/No options.
Statistics! I consider this a great feature. It has Progress Data, Evolving information and an Item Evolving Breakdown. It all updates straight away. Still looking for more useful statistics.
Predefined filter lists.

I'd love to hear feedback. If you guys think of any other useful statistic I'm willing to work it out.
Edit: I expanded the Statistics tab with more information and a cleaner look. Screenshot here.

Your goal: make money, yet still provide a fun experience for free players.
How I'd do it:
There would be one, unified, currency system, noted by the same Pokemoney symbol as the main games.  $1 gives you 1000 Pokemoney.
Pokemon could get injured in battle, and can only be healed two ways: by potions and by waiting until midnight, when all your Pokemon essentially go to a Pokemon Center.
Every day you play, you are credited 1000 Pokemoney.
There is a shop always available, which allows you to spend your money on items that are the same prices as in the main games: Poke Balls are 200, Potions are 300, and higher-grade items cost more.  The higher-grade items are always available, but you won't necessarily need them at the beginning, especially Potions.
You'd also be able to win money through battling other real people, and they wouldn't lose money (because gambling laws).  However, the amount you get is scaled based on your opponent's Pokemon's levels, and you'd only be able to win money from a specific opponent once per day (to prevent farming).

9988	"A theory about starter Pokemon and their availability(or lack thereof)"	"34"	"20"	"20151108"	"ZukoBaratheon"	"What if the reason you can't catch starter Pokemon in the wild is because they're nearly extinct species, and only exist in captivity? It would make sense, with the prominent Pokemon scientist in whichever reason being tasked with restoring the numbers of these Pokemon to some day re-introduce them to the wild. Maybe they were made extinct through human expansion, or predation by more powerful species, or an invasive species taking over their natural habitat, but by some reason they are no longer present in the wild and its up to the professors to restore them. Maybe that's why they're given to new trainers as 'starter' pokemon despite being quite powerful even as non-evolved pokemon: its a project by the Professors to gradually get these Pokemon back into contact with outside species, and to potentially have them breed with other species outside of a laboratory setting and examine how the offspring survive. Going meta with it, when you(the player) breed hundreds of Charmander, or Froakie, or Treecko eggs, just to get your perfect stat Pokemon or a shiny, you are assisting in the bolstering of the numbers of these nearly extinct species of Pokemon.

The rumor is saying that Spain will be the next region, that's cool, I'm down. Very diverse landscape, two major cities, I'd like to see how they differentiate the cultures between Catalunia and Spain.
However, I want to know what you guys would think of going back across the pond, this time, to California. I got this idea in the shower after Sun and Moon were announced, and I think it would be so awesome to see California be the inspiration for a Pokemon region. Two major cities, Silicon Valley, amazing water fronts, two vastly different cultures, snowy mountains with a spectacular lake and everything else in between. The map would be interesting as California is for the most part vertical, but it can be widened a bit. 
I just want to know what you guys would think about California as the inspiration for one of the coming Pokemon games, do you guys have any other preferences or ideas?
Edit: Apparently Hawaii is the new rumour, that would be super sick too.

Then the Region would open up, and you would be able to go to gyms 3-8 in whatever order you wanted.
Each different island would have a different biome and theme, and the central water areas would have different encounters so it didn't fall into the classic trap of Tentacoolapalooza. For example, the northern areas would have more fishlike pokemon, like Magikarp and Basculin, while the southern areas would have Tentacool and Frillish.
Each Gym would have different teams, based on how many badges were obtained prior to the challenge. After collecting all eight badges, you went back to where the game started to battle the elite four.

"0"	"23"	"20160307"	"cardinalwiggles"	"So i've been playing Pokemon Platinum for a few months, training my Pokemon getting skilled, was trying to skill up my Barboach up so i can evolve into Whiscash, now i've been power leveling for quite a while on this stretch of road, so encountered hundreds of Pokemon and low and behold, i've managed to encounter a SHINY Houndour! He was blue and beautiful, i panic not sure what to do, chuck a Ultra ball but no luck he breaks out so i switch out to an Aipom that won't kill him in one hit, start chipping down at the health, and there goes the Roar! My Pokemon bolts and i'll never see that blue beauty ever again. :''(.
How did your first shiny encounters go?  Did they end as awfully as mine? what shiny was your first?

"11"	"17"	"20160307"	"TheFlusteredcustardNot exactly Flaireon"	"Every time I play a Pokemon game it becomes very obvious that the teams are very selective about which rules they break and which rules they follow diligently. For example, imagine if you walked into the team leader's room and confronted him, only to find that he was packing 12 Pokemon instead of the presumably legally set limit of six. Wouldn't that be unique (the first time it happened, at least) and a cool challenge? What would you have the newer villains do to go above and beyond their predecessors in terms of danger and general coolness?

They were exciting for the week after the game came out, then they served no purpose whatsoever. Big whoop, there's a new trainer class in the game world. There is absolutely no reason for them to exist except so that XY could continue the pattern of ""new types"" of battles.
What's next in Sun and Moon? Underwater Battles where only FISH can fight? If they DO decide to add a new battle type in Gen 7, please either make it creative, interesting, and purposeful or just don't include one at all and focus more on new pokemon or the story.

"After being burnt out the whole process of breeding and EV training back in late XY/early ORAS, I tried getting back into it. With my Volcarona and a team of trusty dittos, I once again steeped foot into the world of online Pokemon, except I'm having so much fun preparing that I find no time to actually battle.
I don't know why it's only happening now after so many years of playing pokemon, but I started enjoying breeding. From the crazy shenanigans of obtaining a Pokemon with a specific ability via the Radar or Trade to the puzzle that is passing egg moves and IVs as efficiently as possible each part of it all just feels fun.
I already have over 50 new perfect Pokemon after starting this about a weak and half back. All with perfect IV's and cheesy nicknames, most are EV trained and not a single one has battled yet. Maybe I just need to get back into thing before I start battling again, but right now I'm having more fun raising Pokemon that fighting with them.

10023	"I love how pokemon games have a little something for everyone"	"58"	"23"	"20160307"	"aiphrem"	"There are so many things that make pokemon games, and all these things appeal to many different people. For example, I'm really into breeding perfect pokemon and theory crafting good teams, while my friend just bought his first pokemon game and is loving the discovery/collecting aspect of the game. Like, even if you don't want to get super tryhard in the meta game you can still sink hours and hours into collecting as many pokemon as you can. And if that's not enough, there's a ton of fluff being constantly added with each game that adds a ton more depth. 10 year old me would've gotten a hard on at the sheer quantity of mini games in the more recent games, like the super training, the contests, secret bases, etc.

10024	"Ultimate Pokemon Game Challenge"	"0"	"10"	"20160307"	"ProfFrnswrth"	"Hey all, 
Came up with a pretty tough challenge but I think I am going to try and take it on. The goal? Simple, collect all 720 (Minus Volcanion) Pokemon solo. To do this you will need a few things:

A copy of each Pokemon game featuring a region (2 featuring Kanto [Red/Blue/FireRed/LeafGreen], 2 featuring Johto [Gold/Silver/HeartGold/SoulSilver], 2 featuring Hoenn [Ruby/Saphire/OmegaRuby/AlphaSaphire], etc)
Multiple 3DS systems

Objective: Catch all 720 (Minus Volcanion because there is no event yet) by yourself with only using the games you have and trading between your own games.
Rules:

No cheats, glitches, or WonderTrade
Pokemon obtained from legit Pokemon held events are ok
No trading from a friends game to yours
You can only trade between your own games and can use PokeBank and PokeTransfer.

I may of missed some stuff so please let me know. Think this could be one hell of a challenge for anyone out there as some Pokemon you still have to wait until there are events to obtain.
Good luck!

With that it came to me that one of my favorite looking Pokemon (Tropius), which is nearly useless for competitive battles, could be ""kind of a dragon"". So why not give this Pokemon a new Mega evolution? It worked with Beerdrill or Altaria that got a huge push after their megas got released and I think Mega Tropius-Grass-Dragon with a boost in attack and special attack in combination with chlorophyll would work so well!
So, MEGA-TROPIUS, what's your opinion?

From Bulbapedia:

Porygon made its only major anime appearance in EP038, where two specimens created by Dr. Akihabara appeared, one of which was stolen by Team Rocket, the other borrowed by Ash. Both were left behind at Dr. Akihabara's house at the end of the episode.
This episode caused more than 600 children in Japan to be transferred to hospitals by ambulance because of seizure-like symptoms they reported, due to a flashing strobe effect, and was therefore banned and never aired again anywhere in the world. Since then, Porygon and its evolutions have never played a main role in another episode, despite the fact that it was actually Pikachu who caused the strobe effect which gave children seizures.

Poor Porygon had to carry the weight of the blame and has been shafted ever since. Let's show some love for Porygon.

I don't necessarily mean pre-evolutions or the trade-holding-specific-item evolutions like gen 4, but more of regular leveling evolutions.
I hear lots of people hoping for mega Dunsparce or speculating mega Lunatone/Solrock, but I would much prefer regular evolutions for them.
In SM's case, they could even give a regular evolution to Lunatone/Solrock and then give a mega to the new evolution, just because they seem so relevant. 
I just miss the days of finding that an underrated single or double-stage Pokemon was given another form. I'm not hating on mega evolutions, they can be useful for Pokemon that are already triple-staged or already seem complete like Camerupt or Steelix, but I think that for Pokemon with more potential like Sableye or Mawile, a regular evolution would have done a better job at making them relevant. 
I feel as though a regular evolution would be generally used more, but not just because they're permanent. I often forget that certain megas exist, and although it would also take time to get used to new regular evolutions, I think that they would be easier to remember since they aren't just in battle. In my opinion, I would be more incentivized to use a new Dunsparce evolution than a Mega Dunsparce, for example. 
All in all, I would prefer some new evolutions to old Pokemon in addition to new megas for Pokemon that seem like a mega evolution is fitting (like Flygon sniff). 
TL;DR: I think that slapping megas on every Pokemon that could benefit more from a regular evolution is lame.
Edit: I realize now that this would cause issues with the Eviolite being compatible with Pokemon that already have high-ish base stats, but I'm sure if GameFreak wanted, they could find a way to avoid problems with this.

10078	"A Wager Among Friends"	"6"	"10"	"20160321"	"DragonShiryu2"	"My friend after work yesterday has proposed to me a challenge: Beat pokemon yellow in less than 35 hours and he'll buy me a 3DS and a copy of Sun or Moon when it launches. 
How the hell can I do this? I have until sunday to do it. I currently have 21 hours and 3 badges. I don't see it happening.
My team consists of Charmeleon L28, Dugduo L29, Pikachu L26, Ivysaur L29, Gyarados L28 and a Squirtle at the day care.
Is this even remotely do able?
As an added challenge, he'll buy me copies of omega ruby/alpha sapphire if I catch all 150 Pkmn before the release of Sun/Moon.
Help me /r/pokemon, you're my only hope.
Edit: For all those commenting, I've never played a Pokemon game before.

I think it would lose 2 of it's arms in exchange for the ability to fly;  so it'll gain a partial flying type. The flight comes from it's cape, and the belt is gone; so, it'll be much stronger. If you read the Pokedex for Machamp, it'll make more sense.

I didn't want to walk north into the grass, because as a child brought up nearly exclusively on platformers like Mario and Sonic, I naturally thought the grass were spikes and that I'd die if I touched them.

Of course, both are beasts in combat. Eelektross is my favorite electric type despite how little I've...actually used him (pretty hard to get him since I've only played regular B/W once or twice...everything after that was a nuzlocke).

I understand the idea behind IVs and natures is to account for small variances between Pokemon of the same breed, but seeing as there is only one of each legendary Pokemon it makes no sense that the stats change between instances of loading the game. I feel like this would help level the competitive playing field, but still require work for breeding and EV training. The current format pretty much encourages RNG abuse or hacking to obtain competitively viable legendaries.

Round 4 of ¡§You Have One Pokemon¡¨ is now live for the next 24 hours, starting at 8:00 p.m. (Eastern Standard Time) on April 4. If you would like to play, but have not registered yet, do not go any further until you registered your Pokemon and read the rules in the Registration and Rules Thread. You can check out Round 1, Round 2, and Round 3 for some context. Feel free to jump into the game now, even if you missed the first three rounds.
All Successful Plays are worth $15.
Round 4/5: A Season for Building
[A week and a half after the storm ended, food finally arrived. Two semi-trucks, packed with essentials, got as close to Tranquility Vale as they could, and the residents spent the rest of the day shuttling everything the last few miles back into town. That night, for the first time in a while, everyone ate a proper meal.]
The door to your home creaks as you swing it open. Its interior, usually warm and inviting, is now cold and dark. You have visited here a few times in the past few weeks, but the air inside is thick with the stench of mildew, and you could never stay longer than the few minutes it took to pick up a few useful items before making a hasty retreat. Located so close to the river, this was one of the first houses to be flooded when the sandbags failed, and one of the last to finally be drained of water. The basement has the worst of it. Mold is soaked into the walls and floor, and the smell has made the air down there nigh unbreathable. 
You hold your breath as you make your way downstairs and head to the workbench against the far wall. Tools are scattered about: a hammer, screwdrivers, wrenches, vice grips and a tape measure. Some had been well made, and survived being underwater for days, but others are now starting to show signs of rust. You had a box of nails, but the cheap cardboard had all but disintegrated, and the nails are now lying in an awkward pile. You strap on a tool belt and load it up with whatever you can. You can feel your lungs starting to strain, desperate for another breath. You have what you need for now, so you dash up the stairs, two steps at a time, and hurry to the front door.
You take in a gulp of fresh air, and consider the task that now lies before you. The next few months will be devoted to restoring Tranquility Vale to its former small town glory. The recovery effort has begun, and everybody has turned out to volunteer. Although the starvation crisis has been solved, the town lies in ruins. Power is still out. The lakefront and riverside properties are in shambles, waterlogged and in a state of decay. Some homes have been damaged by falling trees. Debris is everywhere. The sewers are backed up. The farms had been spared the direct damage of flooding, but the seeds had drowned in the downpour and the tilled soil had collapsed under the might of the storm. Arable land would have to be re-plowed, and new crops would have to be sewn if they wanted any sort of harvest come fall. There is a ton of work to be done, and you hardly know where to start.
[You have one Pokemon. For what restoration position are you best suited?]

This Pokemon's type is determined by its personality value (Like how spinda's spots are generated). And when it evolves, it may or may not gain an extra type.
So you might catch one as a steel type that evolves into a steel/grass type or another that evolves into a pure steel type.
Just something I thought of randomly, what do you think?
Edit: Changed information to be more accurate
Edit 2: Maybe to make it less complicated, it starts out with one type and a kind of stone adds the second type.

All You guys have to do is choose between the two pokemon which is your favourite. This is a Double Elimination Tournament which means if a pokemon is eliminated from the first bracket it will then go to the losers bracket for a second try. Throughout all of April I'll be doing Gen 1, next month will be Gen 2 and so on. I will be going through all generations and include a tournament for Mega Evolution at the end. Hopefully by the time this is all over Pokemon SM will be just around the corner.
The Match-ups will take 1 day to finish, the next post will have the results and the next fights. This tournament will continue until there is only one Gen 1 Pokemon left, then we'll start again for gen 2 once its the beginning of next month.

So way back I bought the downloadable version of Pokemon X that came with a 2DS, the one on the SD card. The thing is, that 2DS broke, well the screen did, completely. That was about 3 years ago. Today I finally decided to buy a 3DS because I missed my old 2DS a lot and I've been in the mood for Pokemon for a while.
Went out and bought it, set-up went great, made a Nintendo ID, set up the eshop, all that stuff. But when I inserted the SD card I expected to be greeted with Pokemon X ready to be played. Sadly that is not the case. Pokemon X is on the SD card, but whenever I take the SD card from the 2DS and place it in the new 3DS it doesn't show up. However it works perfectly fine on the 2DS. Is this due to the systems being different? Do I need to link my purchase of the game somewhere to have it work with the 3DS? Am I just being a complete idiot or do I just have to repurchase the game again entirely? I just wanna play some Pokemon :( so if any of you tech experts or someone who knows more than me could help a friend out I will be forever in your debt. I've searched around and no one seems to have the same problem as me so I thought I'd bring it up with you guys. I'll be happy to answer any questions that will help troubleshoot my problem. Thank you so much in advance <3

We like to think he truly forgot and that he depended on the player to remind him what the rivals name is. However, when approaching a gym and reading the pedestal for the first time, who's name is read under ""winning trainers""? When you go into his own family home, what name does his sister use when referring to your rival? When you finally beat the Elite Four, which name does Lance say when referring to the current champion?
In all accounts, the name you will read is the name you gave the rival. The rival holds this name with pride or spite. Which ever it may be, it was your rivals choice to take up the name you gave upon them. Oak may have forgotten or may just be screwing with the rival, but the rival seems to have no interest in correcting him. He is plenty ready to accept the new name.
If we want to call out anyone on being a callous person for disregarding and forceable renaming a rival I suggest we all look to the detective who appears after the robbery at the New Bark Town lab. Based solely on your statement that you fought a trainer who matches the thief's description, he will take literally any name you give the rival and start a manhunt for this person. Never once in the entirety of Gold/Silver does someone use the rival's name in a means that requires the rival having given his true name to the speaker. The only two examples are both random trainers who could very well have just pieced together that the trainer who beat them and the suspected thief are the same person.
So my question to you, are there any other unwarranted criticisms of Pokemon characters which may be better attributed else where? Such as the cop being the true jerk we all like to blame Oak for being?

For me I didn't care about 3D in the game, but at the same time its a nice feature, but for me I just see it as unusable with how poorly it runs. Not sure if the optimization was just bad, or they don't want to sacrifice the graphics for the 3d effects, but I definitely wouldn't mind it being fixed up in sun and moon.

Wouldnt it be cool if pokemon caught from different regions appeared differently on the battlefield? for example,
a pikachu caught in kanto region is a fat pikachu where a pikachu caught in unova has the new ""slim look""
this could also work like the pokemon cards where if you catch a pokemon in a rocket base it could be like '""rockets koffing'"" and the koffing has a 'meaner'' sort of look
just an idea that i think would really be awesome for new pokemon games and would be really fun for collecting purposes

Firstly, I want the feature back where if you headbutt a tree during the day, you find a sleeping Hoothoot. I think it would be awesome if you walked into a cave and found a hibernating Beartic during the winter and when you tried to fight it it would be asleep. Walk into a cave during morning and find a nest of sleeping Zubats. Etc.
Next, I think that it would AWESOME if there were major differences in events depending on the time of day. Imagine an event where an evil grunt steals a Pokemon and then heads into the forest. If it were winter, maybe he'd go a different way than if it were spring. Or maybe if it were day he'd go one way towards the right end of the forest but towards the left at night since the wild spider Pokemon roam for food at night and they've blocked the path with a spider web. Wouldn't that be cool if day/night and seasons changed certain events?
What about how to get to the next town as well? If you went through a cave during the day, you'd have to go a different way because a hoard of Ursaring are blocking the other path. However, at night, you can sneak through the way of the Ursaring since they're all asleep. I think it would be neat to have to sneak around the Ursaring. If you woke them up by moving too fast or touching one of them, they'd all wake up, your trainer would have an exclamation mark appear over their head, then your screen would go black, and you'd appear outside of the entrance with the screen saying, ""You escaped form the hoarde of Ursaring."" Then you'd either have to wait an hour for them all to go back to sleep or go the other way.
I want to see your ideas in the comments if you'd like. I would hope you could all come up with better ideas than mine :P! Thanks :D!

Sure, the Hoenn and Kalos starters have some love (more like ""Hoenn and Greninja"", though), but that seems more like passion borne of recent releases... ""flavour of the month.""
Just saying, I've seen an adorable video of people putting a box of plush Kanto starters in front of babies to see which they'll pick. Cute, but where's the version of Johto? What about Sinnoh? Unova? Heck, the aforementioned Kalos and Hoenn? Anything? No...?
Speaking as a Gen3er, the most glaring omission seems to be... Johto. I'm serious - I can accept that Gen 3 was a divisive generation, but I've been under the impression that Gen 2 was just as beloved as Gen 1, so the lack of love for Johto starters in particular feels... glaring.

You can make an equivalent to red's team in every generation. You need all three starters, the pikaclone, a gift pokemon, and a pokemon that is possible to interact with in the overworld. I tried to make all of the pokemon in each team native to their gen, but a few pokemon are the only option in their category and are from past gens.
So while the original team was Pikachu (pikaclone), Blastoise, Charizard, Venusaur (starters), Lapras or Espeon (both gift pokemon), and Snorlax (interact pokemon), the 4th generation equivalent would be Pachirisu (pikaclone), Emploleon, Infernape, Torterra (starters), Lucario or Togekiss (both gift pokemon given through eggs), and Spiritomb (interact Pokemon) 
The rest of the teams are going to be in this order and I'd love to hear what you guys have to say and any comments or corrections.
1st gen:
Pikachu
Blastoise
Charizard
Venusaur
Lapras or Espeon(could be any eeveelution but esp is canon)
Snorlax

2nd Gen:
Raichu?(the only pikachu clone is technically pichu,I was thinking about making Azumarill be here because of pikablu, but I'm not sure)
Feraligatr
Typhlosion
Meganium
Togetic or Shuckle
Sudowudo

3rd gen:
Plusle or Minun
Swampert
Blaziken
Sceptile
Metagross or Castform
Kecleon

4th gen: 
Pachirisu
Empoleon
Infernape
Torterra
Lucario/Togetic
Spiritomb

5th gen:(based mostly on B2W2)
Emolga
Samurott
Emboar
Serperior

6th gen:

All pokemon must be Water! Dual types are fine.

Have Fun!

It was the only game I ever had (or wanted) and I played it everyday, well mostly every day, we weren't very well off at the time and batteries were expensive. Eventually my dad got a job as a cable guy and we had lots of used remote batteries lying around. After that yeah I played it every day, every car ride, every time I could sneak a few minutes in the bathroom at church. I played it until I literally couldn't play it anymore (darn you missingno.) 
We moved and I discovered other games and hobbies, after that pokemon wasn't really in my life anymore. It wasn't until high school that I would delve back into the world of pokemon with Pearl version. At a time in my life when there was turmoil and frustration pokemon was again there for me. I once again spent hours battling and trading with my friends, which for me was a new feature since I never had a link cable for my original Gameboy. Unfortunately we were all beginning to ""grow up"" and it wasn't too long until pokemon once again faded into the back of my mind (darn you hormones)
Well, seven years later, here I am brand new 3ds and pokemon red in hand. It feels so great to experience the excitement of Kanto all over again. Even the once infuriating task of making my way through mt moon, and god knows how many pesky zubats, has a thick, almost palpable feeling of nostalgia. 
This morning, thankfully off of work, I booted up my save file and headed for Fuchsia city. Finally the safari zone was within reach, the home of, and only place to catch, my all time favorite pokemon....... Scyther. I mean it cant be that hard to catch right, if eight year old me can do it it should be a piece of cake for my, nearly twenty-five year old self. Oh, how wrong I was. After doing a little research on the elusive bug pokemon I only became even more frustrated. Four percent chance for wild encounter, 43.75% chance to flee, God it feels like 99.6% chance to give zero ****s. I've spent all day trying to catch this little shit, I seriously started at around 10AM. Now I realize that eight year old me must have been determined, and I refuse to let him down. 
Its 4PM now, and I've finally done it! Scyther has been caught!!!! High five eight year old me, we did it again! 51 down, only 100 left to go. I know you never completed your pokedex, no worries, I got this.

My nephew is a funny kid and can take a joke, so I was thinking of making the Voltorb pinata a complete joke and have it produce some effect to mess with him. I'm still going to make him a real pinata, but this one would just be used first and surprise him.
?
I need some suggestions as to what I can put inside the pinata. Money is a factor, so it's gotta be cheap. I plan to make a Koffing pinata with those little smokebombs so the kids have to run through them when looting, so I don't want to use those twice (asthma warnings, I know).
?
I was thinking baby powder, but would that get expensive? How much would I need to produce burst big enough for a laugh? 
?
Thanks a lot for the time and consideration.
 ?
?
TL;DR I'm trolling my nephew with a gag Voltorb pinata and need safe, practical, funny suggestions as to what I can fill it with.

Catch a new pokemon and release my Traflagar?(I dont whant to do this becouse he is a starter and I think it will take a lot of expierience out of the game) Or maybe start the game from the beggining and delete the old save?

Recolouring this shiny Sneasel just felt bad (though I can imagine it grew on some people, and they might even love it), and I thought ""If I were to design shiny Pokemon, how would they look like?"" Sneasel, an Ice-Dark Pokemon. I wanted to emphasize both its types, so I came up with this white Sneasel.

Well, I didnt really put as much thought into it as I probably should have, so here is my revised version after watching the recent explosion of videos by various poketubers inspired by bird keeper Toby. 
Type- Dark
Gym Number- 6
Number of Pokemon- 4
Gym Layout- Dark room with an invisible path, similar but opposite to Koga's invisible walls.
Gym trainers- new type of trainer called Star Gazers. They would use any combination of Umbreon, Zorua, Murkrow, Vullaby, Krokorok, and Sharpedo. The gym trainer just before facing me would have a Zoroark, Umbreon, and Sableye.
My pokemon- 
1- Houndoom- level 35
Ability- Unnerve
Moves- Dark Pulse, Fire Fang, Sucker Punch, Punishment
2- Honchkrow- level 37
Ability- Super Luck
Moves- Dark Pulse, Brave Bird, Roost, Sucker Punch
3- Malamar- level 39
Ability- Contrary
Moves- Dark Pulse, Psycho Cut, Payback, Destiny Bond
4- Absol- level 41
Ability- Super Luck
Moves- Swords Dance, Play Rough, Night Slash, Double-Edge
For winning you will get the Celestial Badge, a badge that looks like an eye made up of stars, and the Dark Pulse TM.
Feel free to leave your thoughts, or your gym ideas. This actually spawned a lot of cool conversations last time I posted it, lets see if it does so again.

They also live in the sand, and burrow in the sand. If we're to believe the order of the leaked types means Litten evolves into Fire/Ground, this makes sense.

10309	"Pokemon Sun and Moon Music"	"6"	"8"	"20160523"	"CreepyCinccinoTail Slap Yo Faces :D"	"Of course with the future release of the next two games, everyone has been posting and discussing features that the would like to return and/or introduce. There have also been ideas for possible Pokemon, and people have been constantly creating Fakemon. But what I really want to see from the upcoming games is refreshing and cool music.
To be, Pokemon X and Y had a very lackluster assortment of music. That's not to say it was dull; for example I really like the Wild Pokemon battle  theme and the Route 15 theme. But overall, I caught myself unable to recall many themes from the games. 
From past games, I would find myself humming along to city themes and battle music constantly, but I didn't find myself grooving with X and Y.
Kanto had classics like Lavender Town, Celadon City, The Game Corner. The Johto region had Ecruteak City, Ice Path, and The Team Rocket Themes. Hoenn featured Lilycove City, Rustboro, and lots of trumpets. Sinnoh had some of my favorite themes such as Jubilife City and Barry's Battle theme. And Unova introduced unique gym themes for all the gym leaders in BW2 and had some cool battle themes with Colress and Champion Iris. 
So what do you guys want to see from the upcoming games music wise, and also what are your favorite themes from the games?

I'm not sure if this has already been posted here, if it has, I apologize. 
Do you like stained glass? Pokemon? Of course you do, everyone likes pretty things. 
Stained Glass Geek has set up a Patreon in order to fulfill his dream of doing all 700+ pokemon into stained glass glory. The bonus of all of this is, now for each piece, if you donate even $1, your name is entered into a draw to win said shiny artwork since he now wants to give away each one as it's completed from here on out. He's also set it up so that if you have a 'mon that you really like or don't like, you can donate more or less depending so that your odds are lowered or raised to your own tastes. So far he's given away a Pichu, Cubone and Ralts, the next one is Dratini, and will likely be done in about two weeks to a month depending on his schedule. 
Even if you don't want to become a patron, he does beautiful work that I thought that you guys would appreciate,  but I wanted to boost the signal either way. Thank you for your time if you've read this far. I'll try to upload pictures in the comments.
TL;DR: Shiny artwork, worth at minimum $150 a pop, you can get it for basically nothing if you're lucky and interested.

10319	"Are Pokemon designs getting better or worse over time? Let's look at some data."	"17"	"26"	"20160523"	"totokekedile"	"I came across some genwunners on Reddit the other day, and I thought it'd be interesting to see if their opinion have any support to them. Namely, are the designs of Pokemon truly getting worse over time? Does gen 1 serve as a shining example?
I went over to /r/SampleSize and asked them for their thoughts. As much as I'd love to have people rate every single Pokemon, no one has time for that. Trying to strike a balance between a large sample size and small enough that people don't get bored and not give me any data at all, I settled on 30 Pokemon, 5 from each generation. I chose the representatives for each gen via random number generator to try to keep my own biases from influencing the test. (Because honestly, I'd love to be able to shut down genwunners with hard data.) If a generation has more ugly Pokemon, ugly Pokemon are more likely to be chosen and the same for good looking Pokemon. Hopefully it averages out. The representatives for each generation are as follows;
Gen I: Parasect, Seadra, Golduck, Haunter, Magneton
Gen II: Bellossom, Wobbuffet, Unown, Girafarig, Porygon 2
Gen III: Taillow, Shiftry, Corphish, Lombre, Torchic
Gen IV: Starly, Leafeon, Infernape, Mime Jr., Probopass
Gen V: Emolga, Pansear, Elgyem, Alomomola, Deerling
Gen VI: Talonflame, Aegislash, Sliggoo, Gogoat, Goodra
I asked participants to rank score the Pokemon from 1 to 6, 1 being the best and 6 being the worst. Lower is better because Gen 1 is supposedly the pinnacle. To account for nostalgia, I also asked participants how familiar they are with Pokemon. I will include two sets of data below, one that encompasses everyone and another that filters out everyone except those very unfamiliar with Pokemon and therefore for whom nostalgia is pretty much not a factor. In the raw numbers, ""Unfam"" stands for unfamiliar with Pokemon. With methods out of the way, lets get to results!
Here are the averages and standard deviations data. For those of you who don't want to comb through tons of numbers, here are some highlights. The three least popular in decreasing popularity were Mime Jr., Alomomola, and Probopass. The three most popular in increasing popularity were Torchic, Haunter, and Leafeon. The most controversial were Elgyem, Probopass, and Unown.
If you then group the Pokemon by their generation and average them out, you get an idea of what people thought of the generation as a whole. When you look at everyone as a whole, the consensus seems to be that the quality of Pokemon designs seems to be indeed dropping. However, if you take out the people who have a fond history with earlier Pokemon, the quality of Pokemon designs seems to be holding steady, if not getting slightly better.
Things to keep in mind! 

Whichever graph you look at, remember that either way the trend is very small. If the designs are getting better or worse, it's not by a whole lot.
There are many things participants, especially those unfamiliar with Pokemon, couldn't take into affect with the survey. For example, would Magneton have been rated any lower if the participants had known that Magnemite existed or what it looked like? Would Shiftry have been rated any higher if participants had been more familiar with tengu? I think lore and evolutionary lines can make specific Pokemon's designs more or less appealing.
Pretty much all of the Pokemon had people that hated and loved their design. If you don't like a Pokemon that did well or are a fan of one that didn't, don't worry. You're not alone.
I had a fairly small sample size. 30 Pokemon and 179 participants is probably not completely representative.

What do you guys think?

10323	"Something interesting I noticed about Popplio that may relate to the clown seal's final evolution."	"197"	"120"	"20160517"	"Bitwit64"	"First off, I really hope I'm not too late on this; I don't post here very often. Anyway, a few days ago I came across this post predicting that Popplio will evolve into a circus strongman-like seal. This already seems likely seeing as how Popplio's leaked final typing is Water/Fighting and it would continue with the whole circus theme. During the newest trailer, Popplio shows off this confident pose. This pose could also be showing Popplio's strength as it reminded me of a strongman, and this wouldn't be the first time Game Freak hinted at a final evolution with some sort of stance. I found this image showing how Froakie was depicted with a ninja-like pose before Greninja was officially revealed. So, I think it's pretty safe to assume that Popplio will have some strongman features in the final evolution seeing how Game Freak loves to include little details and hints in the trailers.
TL;DR- A strongman-inspired design for Popplio's final evolution could really be a thing.

So Bulbasaur is the Seed Pokemon, and at first glance it's easy to see what words his English name is a combination of; Bulb and Dinosaur. However the ""saur"" in bulbasaur's name is also ancient greek for lizard!  Funny enough Bulbasaur's name in Japanese doesn't even reference either a lizard or a dinosaur. Instead his name Fushigidane means ""Isn't it strange?"" as well as ""mysterious bulb"". So other than Bulbasaur being a plant-something cross, it's not quite stated what that something is!
As for his design, Bulbasaur does appear reptillian but more of a mammal-like reptile, which is primarily thought to be some kind of Dicynodont; a herbivorous animal that varied in size from rat-sized to ox-sized. Something interesting about Dicynodonts is that they are two-tusked animals and in bulbasaur's official art it only has two visible teeth. However the problem here is that Bulbasaur doesn't seem to share any further similarities between this ancient family of mammal-like reptilians aside form the ""tusks"" and being a quadruped. Instead Bulbasaur short legs and rounded face makes him seem to have more similar qualities to that of a common toad.
Lastly there's that little bulb on its back that makes Bulbasaur's name so appropriate; it is thought that this thought to have taken either inspiration fromis the bulb of a lily (just from looking at Ivysaur and Venusaur) or an onion
If there's interest I'll try make this a daily series! Also shoutouts to bulbapedia where most of this information can be found!

10372	"If Kanto region gets another remake."	"9"	"39"	"20160606"	"the-side-character"	"While I am as hyped as everyone else for the upcoming sun and moon games, I have something in mind that I just really need to share. I know that the idea of remaking a game that has already been remade is a rather iffy thing but Kanto region just has more than meets the eye. To see it in glorious adorable 3d pokemon graphics is a life long dream of mine and there are things that I would like to see if ever this happens.
I think it would be awesome if our character becomes rival with both Red and Blue/Gary. We could be someone who looks up to Red (he could already be the champion in the remake and you're admiring him cuz he came from your town and is super cool and all that) OR we could be going on our journey the same time as them. Gary could be the rival who we often battle with while Red is the one who we often pair with. Imagine going to Silph Company and you get to face off with Gary who is there 'cause he was actually following Red who was trying to stop Team Rocket. He'll decide to fight you instead of Red 'cause he can't find him/catch up to him. After that you meet up with Red and you team up to face the boss. In terms of fighting against the league, your last battle with Gary could be before you head to victory road and after beating the elite 4 you battle with Red before you can be hailed as the champion.
Mr. Fuji and Prof. Blaine can play bigger roles too, we see in the anime special after all that Mr. Fuji is hinted to know about the mega evolution and if I remember correctly the two of them knew each other and had something to do with Mewtwo. We can see the untold story that is the creation of Mewtwo, the abandonment of the old mansion and maybe more.
They could also do more with the sevii/orange islands and have a post game story regarding the unknown since they have temples in the islands. Of course the Team Rocket would have a more sinister plan. The legendary birds could have a story line too. Maybe like what happened between Kyogre and Groudon where they battle agains each other and cause calamities or something. Lavender Town can be more creepy. They can also create a short plot about the biker road just like in the anime. We'd also get to see the luxurious S.S. Anne, the gym leaders and their upgraded gyms and maybe our mom will have a Mr. Mime around the house.
If they put the features that they have now with the current and the upcoming game, I think Kanto region would be tons of fun. There's much more that I can say but I think I've rambled enough. Thank you for your time and let me know what you guys think hehe.
Edit: I just want you guys to know that I also don't want to see Kanto anytime soon and would rather have new games and regions but like if Kanto comes back these are like some things I want to see so yeah. I also wanna add that I wish to see what are your ideas to make the old region feel brand new or things you want to see if ever.

It¡¦s because of that that I thought, where would there be a haunted house of mansion on this map? everywhere seems nice and clean, until I did some research
Hawaii doesn¡¦t have many popular or famous ¡§haunted houses¡¨ most of them are just made for the fun of it and to make money, like a theme park, but if you do your research into haunted places, only three places come up.

Pearl Harbour, for obvious reasons, considering the history behind the place and the amount of death that happened there. A harbour is placed in the same place on the Alola region map as it is in real life, but I think its very unlikely game freak would put pearl harbour in the game, considering it involved japan and american and wouldn¡¦t be very er¡K professional (although it would be a good place to tie it in with the war Lt Surge always spoke about) I doubt this would be implemented in the game¡K or would it?
The Kilauea Volcano, its said that in 1790 the volcano erupted killing 5,400 warriors and their families. Since then, stories about the ghost of the Huna Volcano Goddess, Madam Pele, appearing have persisted.?The ghost is allegedly seen wearing a long, flowy dress walking along forest roads, Those who have seen her claim she often warns of impending explosions and even reputable scientists studying the volcano have reported seeing the ghost. The volcano is also on the map and by the pokemon centre and space centre of some sorts on the top it¡¦s safe to say we will probably end up walking up it at one point, so this is maybe a place we¡¦ll see the ghost? the ghost who will warn us of the eruption? maybe a one that the villainous teams in the new game might be trying to forcefully erupt? maybe a good thing to think about?

And finally theres Wiamea Lookout - Legend has it this popular lookout located on the island of Oahu is actually the site of an ancient burial ground.? Not only have there been several reports of visitors experiencing strange feelings and sensations, supposedly when you drive on the road up to the lookout, you drive over ten distinct bumps but on the way back down, you only drive over seven. The look out in real life is on the other side of the canyon and over looks the water with a group of trees to the left hand side¡K much like the secluded place on the 4th island in the Alola region¡K but instead there being a group of tree¡¦s theres just one big one¡K I have a different theory about this place though as although it could be a place where we might see a ghost in game, it could be a place where we maybe find another legendary pokemon¡K  maybe another ghost typing?
I¡¦ve added photos so you can see for yourself, I¡¦m sure I¡¦ve missed things out, spelt things wrong, etc so please add to anything I¡¦ve said if you like and point anything out that I might have missed

So far I've gained:

2 Articunos
Dialga
Regirock
Giratina w Adamant Griseous orb

At the cost of a dragon scale, 2 magarisers, a metal coat & a kings rock, most of which are reproducible.
I presume that none of these are hacked as there stats are mediocre and why would you hack a legendary but not a trademon so these people must just have a bunch of spare legendaries lying around.

10390	"Wish List for S/M"	"0"	"13"	"20160606"	"Steasy97"	"Yeah, a wish list is nothing inventive, but I was really in the mood wanted to get all this off my chest. So here you (while this is mainly what I wish and not what I BELIEVE we¡¦ll see, I guess a lot of this isn¡¦t that unlikely).
POKEMON
-New ones: Of course I want new Pokemon, but I¡¦d prefer them to keep the number not too high. Gen VI had so many unmemorable Pokemon and that¡¦s always a shame and drags the Generation down for me. Johto introduced just 100 new Pokemon and I¡¦d think that¡¦s the perfect amount and way to only keep the best designs. 
-Old ones: I want there to be lots of different Pokemon from previous Generations from the start. But then again, not as many as in XY, since that was kind of an overkill. So I want them to find a nice balance there.
-New Megas: I mean this is pretty safely going to happen. I¡¦d like to see like 20 new mega evolutions, so somewhere between ORAS (~15) & XY (~25), since it¡¦s a new generation but doesn¡¦t have to throw as many new ones out as XY, since they established Megas yet and there¡¦re a lot out already. I guess it¡¦s likely they¡¦re giving each of the Gen II starters one (Water/Dragon Feraligatr?) and some fan favorites like Mega Flygon, Mega Dragonite, Mega Milotic, Mega Arcanine, Mega Lapras,¡K
-New Evolutions: One reason I don¡¦t want them to put out too many new Megas, is cause I want them to focus again on new ¡¥standard¡¦ evolutions. There so many potential, unfinished and too weak Pokemon out there that could really benefit from it. I'dbe already happy to see like a dozen new evolutions. Since this is often requested and they haven¡¦t done that since Gen IV, this is also not unlikely I¡¦d guess.
-Legendaries: Again, not too many. I¡¦d personally like to have a third Legendary besides Sungaleo and Lunala to make them a trio (something Rayquaza-esque). Then have a duo and a few other ones, but again, not too many. The number of new Legendaries should definitely stay under 10.
My most important point though is that they need to make the games more difficult again. Give the trainers more Pokemon. Make them more varied. Give the Pokemon of more important trainers better movesets, a Mega Evolution here and there later in the game. Balance the levels better of course. Maybe a way would be to include something like a hard mode (that you can choose from the start) if they don't wanna risk losing younger, inexerpienced players attention.
Also, there needs to be cool, lenghty post game content. There's much potential there with the islands. I'd love the post-game to have hard trainers that also use mega evolutions and even more varied Pokemon from odler Generations & stuff.
Last but not least, they managed to tell better stories in the last games. 
I also LOVED the way they told the story in the Delta Episode. If thats any indication for where they're going in Sun & Moon, hell fucking yes.
Some random points at the end:
-I'd like Lillie to be the rival and the Hawaiian kid to be like your partner you have fights against a few times, but you also fight with him in duals.
-EP-Sharer post-game
-Make the islands cool pleazzze. Give them a lil bit of a different feel, put different gym leaders on different islands.
-No ""synergy mechanic""
-Surprises, unexpected things
There's more of course but you get the point I guess.

In the dream it was called Indigo League, don't know if that's got anything to do with current games or anything I can't remember I've never paid much attention to lore or anything I just like fighting and evolving my guys. 
Before reading this please note this was a vague dream and I just wanted to share it. Don't expect this to be balanced or at all well thought out. 
The game was a sort of a multiplayer safari zone where players would go around catching Pokemon with a set number of pokeballs and at the end of the time limit/pokeballs used, the players would have battles to see who had caught the best team. 
I suppose levels would be standardised, and maybe there would be a selection of zones (maps) where different Pokemon can be caught so players would have access to the same Pokemon.

10392	"Solgaleo/Lunala Alchemy"	"0"	"2"	"20160606"	"VaatiReborn"	"As some of you may know, as it is on the Pokemon official website, Solgaleo is called ""the beast that devours the sun"". Through some research, the beast that devours the sun us the Alchemy symbol for the purification of metals. http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-BuG6tUc6rKE/U6WJFe4WBtI/AAAAAAAABy4/cKX-NmOhc0A/s1600/Lion-eating-sun.jpg
The lion is green here in the symbol instead of the white Solgaleo (i'm seeing a shiny green Solgaleo in the future) is because of how you need to oxidize copper. This also makes Solgaleo represented by Albedo. The literal definition of Albedo is the proportion of the incident light or radiation that is reflected by a surface, typically that of a planet or moon. Well Solgaleo is the devourer of the sun. Albedo is the second stage of Alchemy which is white. 
As for Lunala, I went searching. Lunala is represented as ""the beast that calls the moon"". Which has an uncanny resemblance to the alchemy symbol of Nigredo which is also represented by the color black which all represents the stages of the work of Alchemy.The second stage is ""the black water washed by mercurial material"" It starts black as Nigredo  because contents turn black from calcination. 
http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-77RvN1s-xmM/T5ZzFmO1yWI/AAAAAAAAAEs/4XAym--Hpiw/s1600/alimage075.jpg
Look at the picture and then look at Lunala. The man in the picture is Lunala's head in the crescent shape. The stars on Lunala's wings are the stars in the symbol. If we continue the trend, that leaves Citrinitas and Rubedo. 
Citrinitas is represented as yellow refined later as the peacock stage and is multi-colored. As from Wikipedia ""Citrinitas, sometimes referred to as xanthosis, is a term given by alchemists to ""yellowness."" It was one of the four major stages of the alchemical magnum opus, and literally referred to ""transmutation of silver into gold"" or ""yellowing of the lunar consciousness.""In alchemical philosophy, citrinitas stood for the dawning of the ""solar light"" inherent in one's being, and that the reflective ""lunar or soul light"" was no longer necessary. "" This could represent the Eclipse legendary we are thinking will be the third in the trio. 
http://brewingphilosopherstone.weebly.com/uploads/1/2/8/6/12863343/6090096_orig.jpg?318
That is a link to a picture of Citrinitas
But that leaves Rubedo. Rubedo is represented by the color red which is the goal of the work leading to attainment. Wikipedia states ""Rubedo is a Latin word meaning ""redness"" that was adopted by alchemists to define the fourth and final major stage in their magnum opus. Both gold and the philosopher's stone were associated with the color red, as rubedo signalled alchemical success, and the end of the great work. Rubedo is also known by the Greek word, Iosis."" I have a feeling there will be the Lunala, Solgaleo, Citrinitas trio and the Rubedo Pokemon to rule them. This has been done before. Lugia reigns over Zapdos, Articuno and Moltres.
This is awesome. Third gen was represented by the Bible by Behemoth ( Groudon), Levianth (Kyogre, Hebrew for whale), and Ziz ( Rayquaza) 4th gen was time and space. 5th Gen was based off Taoism and the symbols of Yin and Yang, and then 6th gen was based off Norse Mythology and the Yggsadril tree. 7th gen is based of Alchemy

Purple Drowzee (Gen 2.Thats what I called it because back then I wasn't aware of what a shiny was)
shiny Petilil (Gen 5)
shiny Fennekin (Gen 6 hatched)
shiny Snivy (Gen 6 starter chosen from Prof. Birch)
shiny Electrike (Gen 6)

That's as much as I can remember right now, I might be missing one or two shiny from the list. But all I know is that the bulk of my shiny encounters have been in Gen 6.

However, I also feel their should be Key Items that can act as the HM so you will not need the HM itself, similar to Fly and the Eon Flute.
And to make it not to over game breaking, you will need to use the HM to obtain the Key Item, such as a puzzle involving boulders could have a Key Item so the player can use Strength without the HM. (Though it is the air on how Fly could be obtained without reusing the Eon Twins plot of it just being handed to you during the story.)  

Some examples for Key Items:
- Cut = Garden Tools
- Surf = Surfboard
- Flash = Lantern (I am aware Flash is currently a TM)
- Rock Smash = Mallet
- Rock Clime = Grapple
- Fly = Glider  

Without going Legend of Zelda with imbued items, I couldn't think of ones for: Strength, Dive, Whirlpool, or Defog.

The Pokemon Mystery Dungeon games were always my favorite side-game series, I'd even go as far as to say that EOS is my all time favorite game. 
Maybe it's just me being a PMD Gen 1-2er, but Gates and Super were just, not good. Seriously why are the final bosses of the two newer games based on the unjust actions of Pokemon (humans)? Seriously when the bosses were Pokemon it made sense, This is a game for kids, not a life lesson. Plus the story has been less enjoyable and the characters are harder to connect to. 
Honestly I can't remember much of Gates because it wasn't memorable. I did like the concept of building your own town of sorts with facilities and areas, but the fact that with Gates and Super, your entire team levels up is pretty much a Gen 6 XP share that you can't turn off. I didn't like the fact that you could only recruit one of each pokemon in Super, that was pretty lame. Plus there's the inconsistency where when you talk to Chatot, he mentions the guild master as a girl yet in Time, Darkness, and Sky, she is a dude? 
I was honestly super hyped for Gates, hoping it'd be Sky but better, then the same happened for Super, now I don't know if I even want them to continue the series. Sky is honestly a game I can always go back to and find enjoyment in, I actually have two copies, one that is 100% complete, and one that I reset whenever I finish the game just to play it again. 
Now, there's probably a lot of stuff I didn't cover plus I'm scatter-brained right now so most-likely this is composed poorly, but I wanna see initial reactions and opinions. I'd love to see concepts for the game I've never thought of, or different views to look at the games.

Yesterday I was playing Sapphire and I was at the Sky Pillar trying to get Rayquaza.  After a first turn Ice Beam from my Kyogre, I had him in the red and frozen solid (clutch!).  I threw an Ultra Ball (""Oh no!  It appeared to be caught!""), and then for shits and giggles threw a Pokeball, and caught him .. on only my 2nd try!  I remember throwing at least 20 Ultras at him back in the day.  I guess the freezing helped.
THEN, to cap it off, I decided to go after Latias.  I had never seen Latias during my original run of the game back in 2002-2003.  I researched how to find her and set off.  I decided to start in Mauville because it is centrally located. I used a Max Repel and started riding around the routes that border the town .. Within about 30-40 seconds of circling around the grass, I found that thing!!!  I shouted with surprise haha I was like shit, did I forget to actually use the Repel and now I'm bumping into level 17 Zigzagoons .. ?  NOPE.  Caught that dude. 
TL;DR - got Rayquaza and Latias within about 5 minutes of each other, made my inner child smile

I will be going through all generations and include a tournament for Mega Evolution at the end. Hopefully by the time this is all over Pokemon SM will be just around the corner.
The Match-ups will take 1 day to finish, the next post will have the results and the next fights. This tournament will continue until there is only one Gen 2 Pokemon left, then we'll start again for gen 3 once its the beginning of next month.

I caught him,  then flew back to Mauville City and put him in the box that would go to Pokemon bank. I tried to save, but it crashed out of the game when it said Megan saved the ga and it didn't get any further then that. I loaded up bank, and it couldn't load the file, it said I needed to progress further in the game. Uh, I've finished the game and delta episode! So I went back into AS, and it presented me with Your save data is corrupted and that stayed for about 2 seconds before crashing out yet again. It does this every time now and Bank won't have anything to do with it. It's a digital copy, but thankfully most of my pokemon were in the bank and can go into Pokemon X.  But I'm gutted about AS, although I only lost Gallade, Latias, Cosplay Pikachu (yes I still have that tagging along because it's good at contests and can't go in the bank) and Azelf .Help would be appreciated though!

10429	"What is your best idea for a Pokemon spin off game."	"9"	"10"	"20160627"	"bb411114fan since Amphy was the bomb."	"When me and my friend were youngsters we loved to come up with these ideas of spin off games, for the Pokemon series. One of the better ones we came up with was basically a MMO version of animal crossing with Pokemon. Except that all your neighbors were fellow people, and your goal wasn't to catch them all but rather to live with them all. 
There would be various goals that you could meet by your self, in a small group, or in your city. the completion of the goals would encourage various Pokemon to begin to stay in your town, and the surrounding areas.  A example of this would be like planting trees. Each person would have a goal of planting so many trees say 10 in there designated area. Doing so would encourage certain Pokemon to move into the town. Ledyba would be an easy Pokemon to attract this way, but if enough people planted enough trees you might start seeing Heracross.
Going further on this line of thinking there could be community projects like a power plant. If enough people moved into the town they would need to create certain infrastructure, to support the towns growing needs. Building these structures could attract certain Pokemon Voltorb, magnemite, electabuzz, maybe even a Zapdos. 
It would take a community effort to maintain and support there community in order to keep the Pokemon in the area. If the power plant is not kept up then you might see the voltorb leave, or if the water source becomes polluted do to industrial effect then the water Pokemon would leave.
Any way it was fun and still is to come up with these ideas for games, and I was wondering if anyone here has ever come up with a idea for a spin off game.

Pointing out here Hawaian Mythoa has four primary deities
K?, 
K?ne
Lono,
 Kanaloa
Each is based on an elemental binary, Kane with Kanaloa and Ku with Lono
Kane is fire,life, the sun,the north sky and dawn and the tame
Kanaloa is water, death, the moon, the south, the night and the wild
Ku is war,bloodshed, violence,standing
Konno fertility, agriculture, rainfall, music and peace.
You could very easily map these to the four elements with Kane and Kanaloa as fire and water and Ku and Konno as air and earth.
Fitting with the above, Tapu Koko is of air, which fits its thunderbird vibe, as as we know from Thor, the striker gods are often ones of violence and conflict.
This dualism also makes sense given Tapu Kokos patron island, Oahu, where Honolulu and pearl harbour on. The later is a Navy base built for and involved in war. Oahu is also the most industrialized of the islands which makes a nice constrast with an agricultural island, which would be its opposite as Air and Earth are as well as Ku and Lono.
Really I dig the conflationistic style. So many world belief systems work under similar premises its very fun and easy to smash them together. 
I myself just combined Transformers, My Little Pony, Gi Joe, Inhumanoids, Visionaires, Micronauts, Candyland, Diaclone, Norse Myth, Indo European narratives, color theory, and taoism into a single concept and lo and behold alchemy as you as explained it fits perfectly into it. (As does magic the gathering, the four horsemen of the apocalypse, the four playing card suits, the Wu Xing , the four seasons and the four directional gods of china)

ALTHOUGH there are some flaws, like weather effects killing shedinja or status conditions, and fake out could also ruin it. You must also make sure that your simple beam pokemon is faster than your carbink, (if not then use a choice scarf or a lagging tail.) and also make sure that your shedinja has a focus sash.

10452	"17 Types and No Weaknesses??"	"189"	"113"	"20160704"	"clarkeg02Shiny Hunter"	"I got bored on a flight home the other day and decided to explore a question I had been thinking about ever since the 6th gen games came out: if a Pokemon was able to have more than 2 types, is there some combination of them that yields a Pokemon with no weaknesses?
So I wrote a computer program and here are the results:
Total possible combinations with no weaknesses: 809
Smallest combinations that yield no weaknesses:

Flying, Ground, Steel, & Water
Bug, Steel, Water & Dragon

Number of Pokemon with no weaknesses and X number of types:

3 types: 0
4 types: 2
5 types: 9
6 types: 19
7 types: 51
8 types: 77
9 types: 126
10 types: 144
11 types: 142
12 types: 112
13 types: 70
14 types: 35
15 types: 16
16 types: 5
17 types: 1
18 types: 0

Some interesting stats:

Most Possible Resistances: 11 (Magnezone also has 11)
Most Possible Immunities: 8 (AKA all of them)
Most Possible Resistances & Immunities: 15

I was most amazed by the behemoth that was the 17 type Pokemon with 0 weaknesses. It had every type except for Bug, all 8 immunities, and 6 resistances. Insanity.
Note: These stats only apply to the 809 Pokemon I found that have no weaknesses. I also found a Pokemon with 1 weakness and 17 resistances and immunities. The only weakness was water, so giving it the ability water absorb would give it resistances and immunities to all types.

This week's Pokemon is Ampharos!

#181 Ampharos (Japanese ????? Denryu)
The Light Pokemon
Ampharos gives off so much light that it can be seen even from space. People in the old days used the light of this Pokemon to send signals back and forth with others far away.

#180 Flaaffy (Japanese ??? Mokoko)
The Wool Pokemon
Flaaffy's wool quality changes so that it can generate a high amount of static electricity with a small amount of wool. The bare and slick parts of its hide are shielded against electricity.

#179 Mareep (Japanese ???? Merriep)
The Wool Pokemon
Mareep's fluffy coat of wool rubs together and builds a static charge. The more static electricity is charged, the more brightly the lightbulb at the tip of its tail glows.

For me, it's three Pokemon.
First; It's Vaporeon. Hear me out. I always thought Vaporeon was paper-weak when it came to physical attacks since it's defense isn't great, but once I taught her Acid Armor and Wish...She walls almost as well as Umbreon, even better if she gets off 3 Acid Armors. She's insane if she gets a chance to set up in battle, and Baton Pass it too...
Second, Togekiss. When I first tried out Paraflinch Togekiss with Nasty Plot, I was so shocked at how evil and trollish she is, and I love every second of using her. Then when I took a look at her stat distribution, I'm honestly shocked that she isn't used more often; She doesn't have one bad stat, save Attack which never gets used. She's a monster and I love it.
Third, Cloyster. When I first trained my Cloyster, I thought it was going to be awful with it's special defense sta being awful. Little did I know how INSANE Shell Smash+Icicle Spear/Rock Blast combined with Skill Link was. He hits like a machine gun after a shell smash. To this date, I've 3-0ed the 50th battle at the Maison EVERY time with him. Never once have I lost with him against Landorus, Thunderus, and Tornadus. There's a reason I nicknamed him ""King Conch"" :P

The rules are simple. Below are 32 match-ups of 64 Gen 1 Pokemon. All You guys have to do is choose between the two pokemon which is your favourite. This is a Double Elimination Tournament which means if a pokemon is eliminated from the first bracket it will then go to the losers bracket for a second try. Throughout all of April I'll be doing Gen 1, next month will be Gen 2 and so on. I will be going through all generations and include a tournament for Mega Evolution at the end. Hopefully by the time this is all over Pokemon SM will be just around the corner.
The Match-ups will take 1 day to finish, the next post will have the results and the next fights. This tournament will continue until there is only one Gen 1 Pokemon left, then we'll start again for gen 2 once its the beginning of next month.
REMEMBER THIS IS A POPULARITY CONTEST, NOT A ""WHO WOULD WIN IN A FIGHT""

The claim goes into detail saying Nintendo had no faith in it, it was hard to get greenlit and flied in the face of Japan's standard trends, where 80% of the sales come from the first two weeks, instead Pokemon just gained steam.
The reason I question this is that Iwata said GS Development started just after RG finished and the Missing 39. If Pokemon was not expected to be a hit, there was no reason to hold designs back for future releases that probably won't happen.
Is there any evidence from credible sources that show RG took time to build up sales or Nintendo thought 'it'll never catch on'?

I am researching some aspects of player experience for my MSc dissertation and I need a massive number of people to participate in my survey, so if you feel like helping a fellow student to finish her MSc please fill in my 10 min questionnaire (usually takes less). You are supposed to do the survey after you have played a typical game session. At the first page of the questionnaire you will find all the information you need, but I am happy to answer any question you might have.
The questionnaire can be found here:
https://docs.google.com/forms/d/13UUslNdHtZ-VKaLAQjzlSlsrcBO9qLm2Gm7TuqDQc80/viewform
I should note here that we don¡¦t ask personal data other than some demographic questions (such as age, gender, how much you play in general etc.) at the beginning of the questionnaire which are going to be used as a summary in our reports. In any case you have every right to refuse answering or responding to any question asked. Additionally, your data is not going to be connected to you in any way but will be reported as a summary and you are free to ask for the deletion of your data (all your rights are explained in detail at the first page). 
I can¡¦t be very descriptive of my research, as it might influence your responses, but I can give more details after the survey is finished. Also, if you are interested to see the results of my dissertation, feel free to contact me to add you to the list.
Thanks for reading (and hopefully participating to my awesome survey). And thanks to the moderators who let me post it at this forum. 
--- EDIT: The survey is now closed ---
-- Aims: My dissertation is about uncertainty in games. Uncertainty is a relative new topic in player experience research and it is believed that it is connected in some way to immersion. The main aim of my dissertation is to investigate uncertainty in games and construct a questionnaire that measures uncertainty. Constructing a questionnaire requires several steps- my dissertation is concerned with the first one, which is the construction of the questionnaire items (the next steps are for future work). With the analysis of the gathered data we are going to see which items correlate and we will be able to construct the final questionnaire (which will be reduced in number). By doing this work we hope that in the future we will be able to see how these two concepts (immersion and uncertainty) are connected, with possible applications in game design. --

I also thought the game would flop but I was dead wrong about that. Everyone in my city is playing this game but I just found it boring, people I wouldn't have even expected to like Pokemon are playing this game but I can't get into.
I don't play any of the side series games either so maybe that's why. Is there anyone else here who likes the series but not this game?
Edit 1:
I take everything back, I decided to give the game another shot at night after work and playing it in my city was amazing. I still think the game itself isn't too great but the fact that everyone is playing it and talking about Pokemon is insane, I ran into so many people playing and we ended up forming a group and walking around looking for Pokemon. Then on the bus back home every time someone came on with their cell phones out they were playing Pokemon and I talked to so many people just because of this game and walked around random places around my city that I've never been to, it reminded me of the old anime which was amazing because I always wanted to travel around the Pokemon world like ash did and today I got close!
The experience of playing this game is what makes it great.

I have a few chapters so far, and I would love it if you guys would check it out and tell me what you thought!

Adamant mega aerodactyl with:
252 att, 252 speed, 4??
crunch
earthquake
stone miss (really need to change)
Aerial ace
Adamant Azumarill leftovers (mainly to cover ice weakness)
252 att, 252 hp, 4??
Waterfall
aqua jet
belly drum
play rough
Venosaur black sludge (can't remember nature but something beefy)
252 hp, 252 def, 4 spdef
synthetis
giga drain
leech seed
sludge bomb
This team seems to work really well, due to venosaur covers for electric weakness, while azumarill takes the rest aerodactyl can't handle.
I think aerodactyl is quite lackluster at the moment though, so i want to swap it for either mega scizor or mega metagross what are your thoughts on either?
Scizors (adamant 252 att, 252 hp, 4, def) moveset would be:
bullet punch
roost
swords dance
thief
While metagross would be either adamant or jolly, haven't decided yet, depends on what moveset i settle with:
bullet punch/iron head
ice punch
power up punch
rest/thunder punch

Since I am the resident Poke-Nerd, I steered them away from the (very boring) train wreck that is Johto, and convinced them to start with Advanced Generation. 
I was going to just give them a link to one of the already created filler guides, but the ones I found were either too short or too long, and many of them didn't even say WHY they included certain episodes. I appreciate all the work these fine gentlemen did, but I knew I could do something more... unique.
So I created this, an Advanced Generation (a.k.a the May Arc) guide, with tailorabilty in mind. You want to go baby, go? Just follow the green episodes. Just want to skip needless filler? Then follow the list to a ""T"". It caters to everyone, and everybody in between, including a reason for being there, as spoiler-free as possible (for the rare times the team loses, lol).

They could appear as sort of a second stage you would unlock after you beat the first four totems. My guess would probably be Ground/Rock for desert island, Poison for a swamp island, steel for an artificial or manmade island, and ice for a, well, ice island.

This is about Black and White 3, set in an alternative timeline.
10 years ago, N succeeded in creating his perfect world. All Pokemon were released. No more fighting, no gyms, no trainers - no more suffering. Humans live in isolated cities - seperate from Pokemon, who live in the wilderness.
But ending the enslavement of the Pokemon came with a price. The worlds economy, which was strongly dependant on Pokemon, collapsed. Poverty is now an issue, crime rates increase continuously. To control the situation, N and Ghetsis rule with an iron fist, as Team Plasma members are now the only ones who are allowed to use Pokemon.
In the midst of all this, you as the protagonist seek for revenge. Your father, a famous gym leader, and your mother, a renowned Pokemon breeder, both lost their job, had to sell everything they had and fell into depression. Your father, now a broken man, tried to revolt against the system, but was pinned down and executed before your eyes. Your mother snapped and is in a catatonic state of resignation ever since. The only one you can still rely on, is your childhood friend next door.
This childhood friend was always like a brother for you, and even though there is a certain feeling of rivalry between the both of you, your souls are connected by the hatred for this new world, created by N.
As dare and as secret sign of resistance towards N, you and your friend regularly sneek into the wild to get in contact with Pokemon, something that is strictly forbidden by the new government.
One day however, you nearly get caught by Team Plasma during your trip in the outskirts. The only thing that saves you, is a diversionary tactic used by your friend, who gets caught in your place and is sentenced to death.
Driven by a sense of guilt, you want to save your friend from the execution. It is now that you remember the advice your father gave you when you where just a little child: ""If you ever find yourself in a pinch, if there is no way out anymore, look for the thing whose value only those with a strong bond to Pokemon will cherish.""
Eventually, you check the showcase containing the remaining gym badges your father had in store. As you trigger a hidden switch at the back of the showcase, a Master Ball pops out. The prized posession your family once was awarded with for raising some of the strongest Pokemon in the region and for forcing aspiring trainers to go all out in the best gym of the country. A true rarity, as all Pokeballs were thought to be destroyed by Team Plasma by now.
You now know what to do. After sneaking into an especially dangerous territory of the outskirts, you are attacked by 3 extremely strong Pokemon. After catching one of your choice, you rescue your friend from the execution, steal some Pokeballs from the defeated Team Plasma members and both of you swear to go from town to town to eradicate Team Plasma and finally kill N.
The rebellion starts here.?

I realize a game set in Ancient Greece could cause some logistical problems concerning needed technology for healing, trading, etc., but hear me out.
In the video, he talks about how the gym leaders and elite four could be Greek god-based and the story could revolve around one of the many myths.  What if instead, the gym leaders and elite four are the inspiration for those stories.  Your character could be hero-based, who completed a great feat and was enshrined with the gods afterward (entering the Hall of Fame after beating them).  The villainous team is the source for stories surrounding the Titans.  It would be an interesting way to look at how the true feats and stories get distorted with time.
This could line up with so much within the Greek mythology.  The ""titans"" ruling over Pokemon, instead of befriending them.  A member of them who is sympathetic with the Pokemon and helps them (Prometheus).  A group (the Olympians) form to change how Pokemon are treated and a war starts between the groups.
The new Pokemon ideas are staggering if you take from the Greek legends, as well as the historic locations to be explored.
I am a big fan of ancient mythologies, so maybe this only appeals to me and would be meshing too much together.  Still, I think it would be interesting to see a game set in the past.  The trainer you play as could become part of the mythos in a later game (like Red was in gen II).

I recently decided to do a New run through of Alpha Sapphire, using only Philemon from the original 151 that correspond to the colors of the rainbow; I.e. R.O.Y.G.B.I.V. (ALTHOUGH I combined the last two to make purple what with the six pokemon limit.)
Oh, and I am only using shinies.
First up chain fishing with a fainted inkay to get a gold magikarp for a red Gyrados. 
It was tiring as I had my count up to over 200, but I did it.
Next up, the bane of my existence: shiny machop.
I have spent 2 days, and I am over 300 in my dexnav with still no shiny. I just want a green Machamp.
I can't help but realize after doing the exact same thing over 500 times that this is insanity: the act of repeating something over and over in the hopes of a different outcome.
I am not looking forward to the other four member of my team...
Arcanine for yellow
Electrode for blue
Parasect for Orange (I know it isn't perfect, but it's better than raticate)
And Kingdra for purple.
Why can't I just enjoy the game like a normal person?
Probably for the same reason I made my own challenging cosplay builds in Dark Souls 2:
I am an insane glutton for punishment.
Wish me luck!
:)
UPDATE: Got my Machop at 356 after work!
UPDATE: Trying out soft reset Pokemon hunting. Trying to get a shiny electrode from Team Aqua Hideout. So far, up to 200 soft resets, no luck.
UPDATE: I finally got my shiny electrode, halfway there, only 2000 or so resets.

10596	"My first Nuzlocke run."	"6"	"14"	"20160815"	"NoDiggity96"	"So yesterday I decided to try my hand at a Nuzlocke run on Fire Red (my personal favorite). After putting in around 10 hours since yesterday morning, it all came to an abrupt end in Lavender Town.
Long story short, I lost a lot of good friends through my short experience with the challenge, but I must say, the worst was when I lost my starter. I raised Buddy the Bulbasaur from when he was but a wee lad. Tragically, he was no match for my first encounter with that monstrous meatball known as Snorlax. At that point, I had lost a total of four companions (Ratdog the Raticate, Nii the Dratini, Doug the Dugtrio, and Hellcat the Flareon) before I met Snorlax and the only two left were Buddy and Birdman the Pidgeotto. Buddy fell first in that epic final battle and Birdman have it his all but was, in the end, nothing short of bested.
Overall it was a grand adventure. Even though I was cut short after merely four gyms, it was the most fun I had ever had since I first played Gold on my GameBoy Color. To anyone thinking of trying the challenge, you will not regret it.
As for now, I am going to attempt to redeem myself by taking a trip to Hoenn and starting a new adventure with new friends there. Wish me luck.

10597	"What is your least favorite Anime travelling team and why?"	"10"	"18"	"20160815"	"ViroroStill a proud XY fan."	"Personally, in my case, it's probably the BW trio. In general, after AG and DP returning to an Original Series-esque trio just didn't work, forcing Ash back into the rookie beginner position and having Iris and Cilan shallowly copying the basic character traits of Misty and Brock (tsundere girl who treats Ash as a kid and seasoned beginner leader of the first Gym of the region) while either adding little of their own: Iris literally has very few character traits that Misty didn't also have (and some of the mirrors don't even make sense: Misty's phobia of bug Pokemon has basis in reality, while Iris' Ice-type fear is so ridicolously filmsy explained as 'because dragons are weak to Ice' it's mocked even in-universe by pointing out she'd have to be afraid of dragons too by that token), and her team of Pokemon is full of terribly unlikable characters except maybe Axew (if you don't find him annoying in another way) or Excadrill); as for Cilan, he honestly comes across as being all flash and no substance, with very little serious character development and his personal episodes mostly being related to wacky hijinks unless they dealt with his brothers.
Doesn't help that, overall, they are probably the group that felt the least like friends for Ash in my opinion. They just up and left for Johto after they literally travelled to Kanto to meet Professor Oak without even going to Pallet Town, plus they always seemed kinda condescending of what Ash did (Iris in particular with her 'you are such a kid!': when Misty did it not only it worked better since Ash WAS a beginner, but she clearly cared and supported him and mellowed out slowly. With Iris it really feels mean-spirited and like she has to put down Ash every single time he does something, not helped by how BW Ash is really dumber than his previous iterations).

"1"	"6"	"20160425"	"nosi40The Commander"	"Instead of studying for finals, I started to go back and watch some of Ash's battles today (as one often does). After going through some of his best ones, I felt that in the anime and in the games, the 6th generation appears to be unrefined and mysterious.
Take for example the new upcoming games. We were given Xerneas, Yveltal and Zygarde. Two of them were box legendaries. But Zygarde is one that we know almost nothing about! And it isn't just in the games, it's in the anime too! We were told of Zygarde's forms but then given no other information. In the games, Zygarde is a mysterious cave legendary that we know nothing about. Even in the anime, we see 'Squishy' but no other information has been revealed about it. Because of the lack of reveals lately, I only learned about Zygarde core's abilities through watching the anime. And some of those abilities might not even be in the next games.
Speaking of the next games, why were we told about Sun and Moon? Is it a new region? Is it a new generation? Why wasn't it Pokemon Z? Also why didn't we get Volcanion in Pokemon X and Y? He was clearly coded into the games but he wasn't officially revealed until much time later. And he can't even be obtained without cheating! Not even that, but what is Magearna? Why isn't Magearna's data found in Pokemon X and Y? Clearly Volcanion and Magearna are linked somehow but even that was found out when the new movie details were revealed. 
Going back to the anime, what even is Ash-Greninja? Is it a new form? Or is it something that we will see in the future? Also, why does Ash only have two rivals this season? We know that Alain isn't likely to participate in the Kalos league. Is Sawyer really going to become a trainer worthy of being Ash's rival? Speaking of characters, why haven't we seen Alexa in a while? Why is there more character development for Serena instead of Ash? And the biggest question of all... where is Ash's relationship with Serena going to go?!
I can't be the only one with so many questions! In a way, I'm happy that the creators are withholding so much information. I'm always on the edge of my seat as I check news sites everyday hoping for a new reveal or a leak of some kind. But it also makes me really anxious because I want to know more! What do you guys think? Can you answer some of my many questions?

So I was wandering how could they retcon the series to lineup with this new timeline? Then it hit me! They confirm the coma theory.
They could have it so that ash has been in a coma for several years now, so we get him aged a bit. Also since he had spent so long learning the wrong thing in his dreams, they could force him to actually fight smart drawing on the experience he had while in his coma.
To top it off, and include another theory, they could have all of this brought on as Ho-oh granting ash's wish, just in a backwards way. Meaning he made him go into a coma to experience all of these battles so that he could learn from them but still allow him to win so he would never be discouraged. All so that he could eventually wake up and become a true pokemon master.
Dumb? Yup. Unlikely? An understatement. But still a fun idea.

Throughout all of April I'll be doing Gen 1, next month will be Gen 2 and so on. I will be going through all generations and include a tournament for Mega Evolution at the end. Hopefully by the time this is all over Pokemon SM will be just around the corner.
The Match-ups will take 1 day to finish, the next post will have the results and the next fights. This tournament will continue until there is only one Gen 1 Pokemon left, then we'll start again for gen 2 once its the beginning of next month.

10638	"My theory on education in the Pokemon World"	"55"	"15"	"20160704"	"igoyuu"	"The Pokemon world has some sort of compulsory education. That is both kindergarten (4-5 years old) where the children learn simple reading, writing and mathematics and elementary school (6-11 years old) where they study various subjects such as geography, history and natural sciences. 
Compulsory education ends either when one finishes elementary school or obtains a school leaving certificate. To obtain a school leaving certificate, one must be at least eight years old (though most are ten) and must demonstrate sufficient knowledge in various subjects as well as cooking and survival techniques. About 50-60% of children obtain a school leaving certificate, the others finish school normally. Both options result in permission to work and leave home. However, one can only be a proper Pokemon trainer after having turned ten years old.
Secondary education has two stages: basic and advanced. Both last three years. Basic makes one choose a broader field of expertise, such as ¡§history¡¨ or ¡§engineering¡¨, while advanced offers an even more specialized education. For example, ¡§history¡¨ may have ¡§Ancient Kalosian History¡¨ or ¡§History of Pokemon Evolution¡¨. Secondary education institutions are scarce, for not many students attend these courses. About 20% finish a basic course and only about 5% an advanced course. The institutions do not provide accommodations or meals, which means that most students work part-time unless they live at home.
Since many schools are so specialized, students aged 12-14 and especially 15-17 often travel wide to attend an institution with courses of their choice. This is even more understandable if we look at the numbers: (skip this part if you don¡¦t want to read my calculations)
Let¡¦s assume Violet City (Johto) has a population of about 270.000 (I determined this by a multitude of factors, including the pop. of its real world counterpart Nara and its appearance in the games).
If the Pokemon world has a stable population with a fertility rate of about 2,1 children per women, it means approximately 20 percent are aged 0-15 (for this I used about the same percentage as the US, which is approaching a stable and healthy population distribution across ages ¡V actually it¡¦s 19%, but I 20% make calculations easier).
Therefore, in Violet City, on any given day we should have 54.000 children and teenagers aged 0-14, of which 3.600 are the same age. Assuming there are not drastically more seventeen-year-olds than fourteen-year-olds, this means about 720 14/15-year olds and 180 17/18-year olds graduate each year. If in a city with 270.000 inhabitants less than thousand graduate each year, we can conclude that there should be very few schools to deal with this student population.
(end of calculations)
Of course, there are options for people who have disrupted their education, but later want to obtain a higher degree. These institutes offer courses similar to secondary education schools, but it only takes two years to gain a basic and an advanced degree, respectively. Anyone who has at least a school leaving certificate can take these courses. About 35 percent gain a basic degree later in life, while 15 percent manage to complete an advanced degree. 
As so many children and teenagers are joining the working force each year, employers in the Pokemon world also offer a wide range of apprenticeships. To start an apprenticeship, one must be at least ten years old. However, it is possible for 6+ year olds to make money by working part time in a ¡§youth-suitable¡¨ profession, such as waiting tables or working in retail. Coal mining, engineering or other dangerous work can only be done by people aged 12 or older. 
Catering to Pokemon Trainers are various Trainer Academies, which may teach general knowledge about Pokemon or be fixated on a single type. Some of them also specialize in other fields, such as Pokemon Contests.
Not to be forgotten is the expanded Ranger School, which produces more than 200 splendid Pokemon Rangers, Operators and Mechanics each year. It accepts students from all over the world aged 10-14 and lets them study and train there for two years in order to become a person capable of protecting other people, Pokemon and nature.

Holy shit, I actually did it! For everyone who has held out until here, thank you very much! Please let me know your thoughts and whether I should expand upon this piece of work. Also, please excuse any mistakes (or even better, tell me) since English is not my first language. This is the first time I¡¦ve written something speculative of this magnitude, and I¡¦m kind of nervous and wondering if I did well enough.

Having recently gotten remakes, it's surprising to see what evolutionary lines have yet to get Mega Evolutions, including the high in demand Mega Evolutions of Flygon & Milotic.
The Pokemon from this region that I think should get Mega Evolutions are...
Mega Mightyena - There's a severe lack of feline-like Pokemon when it comes to what Pokemon have received Megas.

http://orig07.deviantart.net/6538/f/2013/251/1/7/mega_mightyena_by_mr_tiaa-d6ll7ml.png
Mega Linoone - An all-terrain Pokemon that's helped many a trainer through their journeys in Hoenn should get one.
http://pm1.narvii.com/5845/7688596f9f808b28cb660c8fcfee3ad10057ae27_hq.jpg
Mega Dustox & Beautifly - I'm a little iffy on Beautifly due to the fact that it looks graceful enough as it is but if it had to get a Mega, I'd say they could make it...spread it's wings?

https://static.pokemonpets.com/images/monsters-images-800-800/8269-Mega-Dustox.png
Mega Masquerain - It's a tropical based region, why not have a Water/Bug fly that will journey across the waters of the four islands?
http://i.imgur.com/jhGArYd.png
Exploud - I forget the poor thing half the time when it comes to journeying through the region. I'm not sure why, you can encounter Whismur pretty early on in the game. Exploud NEEDS this.
http://img07.deviantart.net/c1fd/i/2015/032/4/2/mega_exploud_by_neoz7-d8g90mh.png
Mega Delcatty - It could pass off as a Normal/Fairy.

Mega Volbeat & Illumise - Come on Electric/Bugs.

Mega Torkoal - I'd imagine that this has something to do with an erupting volcano where Torkoal prosper or a Fire/Poison type that releases toxic fumes.
http://pre05.deviantart.net/aeb5/th/pre/i/2013/338/6/6/mega_torkoal_by_thefresco-d6wq94t.jpg
Mega Grumpig - This needs to happen, I just love the design opportunities.
http://orig01.deviantart.net/b5aa/f/2015/164/9/e/mega_grumpig_by_smiley_fakemon-d8x4so2.png
Mega Lunatone & Solrock - It's the Sun & Moon region, it wouldn't make sense to not include these two.
http://pm1.narvii.com/5868/0ee93067d9c338a8fe0abf6bc91cc0d0e3cbed49_hq.jpg

Off-topic, the designs for Mega Lunatone are creepy.
Mega Seviper & Zangoose - Seeing these two in a full-on duel against each other would be amazing.

As for Cacturne & Crawdaunt, they could have something going on with the influence of the Dark type that they share but I just can't see it happening with Banette and Scizor already prevalent.
Mega Armaldo & Lileep - To what their original forms may have looked like.

Mega Tropius - Like Exploud and many of the Pokemon that don't evolve, Tropius needs something to make it relevant again. It has the potential.

http://img00.deviantart.net/7d46/i/2014/166/0/7/mega_tropius_by_shinyhunterf-d7mhn8u.png

Mega Huntail & Gorebyss - This design for Huntail makes it look like a beast. These two must roam the seas.

Pairing this with the information received so many times that  ""Rockruff"" along with the new starters is special, could Rockruff possibly be a new variation on the Eevee ideology?

And now realizing that since Cosplay Pikachu is bank incompatible it will likely also have to be left behind I am just sad.

It's just kind of disappointing that the games harp so much on appreciating and caring about your Pokemon and then some inevitably aren't allowed to come with me on my next journey.

10712	"Speculating on what Marshadow is."	"9"	"22"	"20161003"	"WhiteFox1992I shall paint your doom"	"The leaks state it will have a unique type combination. Many also speculate it is the trio master for the Sun and Moon legendaries.  

If it is the trio master then it will most likely have Psychic as one of its types, and following the leak's ""unique"" clame, it combination type will be: Psychic/Bug, Psychic/Electric, or Psychcic/Poison.  

However, if its name Marshadow it to be taken as Mars-Shadow. Then Mars can be used for the type Fire (the planet Mars), Fighting (Mars the god of war), Steel (Is the alchemic icon for iron), Poison (Mars at night symbolises Scorpio), or Fairy (Mars in the day represents Aries).
While shadow most likely meaning Ghost because all moves with ""Shadow"" in the name are Ghost type such as Shadow Ball, Shadow Sneak, and Shadow Claw. Of this: the only unused type combo is Ghost/Fighting (because of Mimikyu being Ghost/Fairy).
But, Shadow could also be Psychic (Because Shadow Tag is a Psychic ability and all Day/Night Pokemon are Psychic such as Lunatone/Solrock or Espeon) or Dark as a shadow is dark (and because Umbreon). Adding the additional type unique combos of: Psychic/Poison, and Dark/Fairy.  

If Marshadow is a Psychic/Poison it is most lickly a scorpion with a design based on Scorpio.
Or if it based on a Dark/Fairy then it will mostilkly be based on a goat with it being based on Aries.
But if it is a Ghost/Fighting then it could be anything. But will visually be very muscular with heavy amounts of armor like plating to represent Mars the roman god of War.  

However, less likely it could also be taken from Marsh-(a)-Dow. Wich ""Marsh"" could be typed as Grass, Water, Bug, or Poison. And ""Dow"" meaning ""to prosper"" could be ""Normal"", Dragon, Psychic, or Grass. (If it had the Normal type then it most likely will have some ability or form wich will change that type to any of a number of types.)
Continue pointing out the unique types, then the combos are: Bug/Normal, Poison/Normal,  Bug/Dragon, and Poison/Psychic.
None of these type combinations combined with its name would help determine what it is besides something found in a swamp such as a frog or turtle.  

Now, Pokemon's director Masuda has addressed that he wants Sun and Moon to be unpredictable. Meaning three things in this case;
One - Marhsadow may actually not be even a legendary.
Two - Assuming it is still a legendary might have nothing to do with Solgaleo or Lunala.
Three - May be intentionally designed to be the opposite of what its name is implied it to be.
Now, those first two points could be used to benifit everything else I said of the last two sections. However, the third point.
Science (and Pokemon) uses the icon of Mars to mean Male. And Pokemon uses Shadow to mean Ghost or evil.
Reversing its name, Marshadow may be renamed something like ""Venuslight"". Becoming a femine Pokemon with the type combination based on prosperity and love. Meaning: it might be part Fairy.
With the unique Fairy typing being: Fairy/Fire, Fairy/Fighting, Fairy/Dark, Fairy/Ground, or Fairy/Poison. But, to avoid its name being fully pointless the less likely combo being Fairy/Ground.
Collectively, if we base it on the opposite of its name then this would mean Marshadow is humanoid like Mars, or be based on spears (meaning an animal desined to look like a spear such as a swordfish or snake) because that is Mars's usual weapon. And will probably have its dex entries all say it takes pleasure in wars and destroying the enviroment, as that is what the Roman god of war, Mars, enjoys.

#705 Sliggoo (Japanese ???? Numeil)

10728	"Show Theory: Lighthouse Dragonite is from Pokemon Land"	"5"	"14"	"20161017"	"creaturecatzzflair for creaturecatzz"	"There are a few reasons why I believe this is true;
One is obviously that ratio of the real Pokemon to the mechanical ones is pretty similar to that of Charizard to fake Charizard.
Another is that it doesn't say it's name but just those moans it does. I have reason to believe that Giovanni would want to make the mechanical Pokemon as lifelike as possible and as a result would want to put features in the machines on his island. And what better Pokemon than one as iconic Pokemon as Dragonite. The reason I'm calling Dragonite iconic over the starters is that in the show, Lance is one of the top trainers and his Dragonite one of the most fearsome in the Indigo League. 
Third is that if they were to be putting features like that in the Pokemon then they'd want to keep it waterproof from rain and it waking through the shallows in the ocean. 
Adding to this it'd make sense that Giovanni would be able to make Dragonite able to react to 'pain'.
I think this is a pretty solid theory and would like to hear what you guys think. And if this is already out they then I just look silly now don't I.

10729	"Info about Ash's Greninja from the demo"	"25"	"16"	"20161017"	"steakman5<--- Shoulda been in Smash"	"So the greninja from the demo has the id number 131017 and the original trainer ""Ash"". If you were wondering, I found that October 17th, 2013 was the release date of the XY anime in Japan. Its stats are as follows:
Gender: Male
Level 36
HP: 105
Attack: 96
Defense: 60
Special Attack: 101
Special Defense: 63
Speed: 126
It has the moves
Water shuriken
Aerial Ace
Double team
Night Slash
When initially received, it has 40,007 exp. points and needs 3,801 until level 37.
So that's what we know about the Greninja so far, and I believe someone on Smogon calculated the ivs and the nature. Just thought it would be something people might want to know a bit early!

10754	"[Spoilers] [Discussion] Here's my theory on Ultra Beasts and why I believe they resemble other trainers."	"153"	"60"	"20161024"	"Scar7752OSHAAAAAA"	"Note: This references the demo's datamining.
So after talking about UB's with a few friends, I've come up with a sinple idea about what Ultra Beasts are, and why a lot of them closely resemble trainers we meet in our journey. 
I know that many people believe that the characters that have a similar appearance to UB's are actually Beasts themselves, but I disagree. I believe that the forms UB's take in the games resemble trainers that are powerful in Alola, for one reason or another, but have no relation to said trainers other than appearance and possibly a few character traits. When they show up in the games, they sense a trainer that stands out to them and takes on their appearance and possibly a few features of their character, such as (speculating) how Beauty poses incredibly similarly to Lusamine, or how the UB resembling Guzma could be (again speculating) wild and irrational. This also may explain why Absorption could be Gladion's character: instead of taking his physical appearance, it takes form of Gladion's rage, as it must have stood out to the UB as a very powerful trait. 
I guess we'll all find out next month what they actually might be, I just felt like sharing my thoughts and was curious how you felt as well.

I find ash's journey has been long enough (was hoping he would win in kalos, but then he lost to blast burn) so I thought of an idea. After he finishes school in Alola he has the bright idea of rechallenging every region in like a montage Type of episode. Where he beats all 8 gyms with the Pokemon he used then and there (example: he would use his pikachu and now pidgeot vs Brock). After obtaining all the badges he would beat the leagues and refuse championship. He would do this 5 times until in kalos, he is with Serena again and she finally confesses. Making ash want to stay he accepts championship and stays in kalos with Serena living happily ever after. About 10 years later ash's son goes on his adventure and we now follow him and his pichu around kanto again. So what do you guys think? It doesn't seem like it would happen but I still feel like this would be a great way to let ash go and get a new protagonist that would have to face problems like ash did but it wouldn't make ash look stupid (cough* lvl 5 snivy cough*).

This will include Archer, as he's technically the head of team rocket in the johto games. Giovanni's team will be from his encounter in Saffron, as it's the last time you're fighting him as an evil team leader and not a gym leader.
Archer (HGSS): Lvl 35 Houndour, Lvl 35 koffing, lvl 38 Houndoom.
Giovanni (FRLG):  Lvl 37 Nidorino,  Lvl 35 Kangaskhan, Lvl 37 rhyhorn, lvl 41 Nidoqueen.
Archie (OrAs):  Lvl 41 Mightyena, Lvl 41 Muk, Lvl 41 crobat, lvl 43 Sharpedo.
Maxie (OrAs): Lvl 41 Mightyena, Lvl 41 Weezing, lvl 41 Crobat, lvl 43 Camerupt. 
Cyrus (Platinum): Lvl 45 Houndoom, Lvl 46 crobat, lvl 46 gyarados, lvl 47 Honchkrow, Lvl 48 Weavile.
Ghetsis (B and W 1): Lvl 52 Cofragrigus, Lvl  52 Bouffalant, Lvl 52 Seismitoad, Lvl 52 Bisharp, Lvl 52 Eelektross, Lvl 54 Hydreigon.
Ghetsis (B and W 2):  Lvl 50 Cofragigus, Lvl 50 Seismitoad, lvl 50 Eelektross, Lvl 50 Drapion, Lvl 50 Toxicroak, lvl 52 Hydreigon.
Lysandre (X and Y): Lvl 49 Mienshao,  lvl 51 Pyroar, Lvl 49 Honchkrow, Lvl 53 Gyarados.
So, the list goes:
 Archer, Giovanni, Maxie=Archie, Cyrus, Lysandre, Ghetsis (B and W 2), Ghetsis (B and W 1).
So Archer is the weakest (Understandable, as he was just an admin, and Ghetsis in B and W 1 is the strongest, (Weird, he got weaker in 2 years).

Since Farfetch'd's appearance shares many similarities to real ducks I believe Farfetch'd was inspired by one. Based on the original sprites for Farfetch'd:

Dark brown feathers which most female ducks have
A white circle around the eye, which some ducks have but not all, like a Steller's Eider (female)
A tufted patch of feathers at the top of Farfetch'd closely resembles some ducks like the Scaly-sided Merganser
The 'V' eyebrows which closely resembles the pointed crest on a Japanese waxwing

One major problem in finding the real life duck is Farfetch'd's weight being 33.1 lbs.
Dabbling ducks are only 1-5 lbs. which is no where near Farfetch'd's.
A shot in the dark but does anyone know of which duck might be the inspiration behind Farfetch'd's design?

10820	"My theory about Incineroar's Possible Inspiration."	"17"	"10"	"20161114"	"TheMagneticDragon"	"Incineroar is a Fire-Dark type pokemon that is listed as the Heel Pokemon ""a famous wresling term which tends to mean the bad guy in a wrestling story arc"".
It is known to be a very aggressive Pokemon to not only it's opponents but also it's allies and trainers as well. However, it always feels joy whenever children tend to cheer for it.
Many people believe that the inspiration for this pokemon would be Tiger Mask, a very famous manga character in Japan from the 1960's who was originially a heel but then eventually turned into a face due to how a child always cheered him on as if he were a good guy (or face in wrestling terms).
However, I believe that there could be another possible wrestler who could be an inspiration for Incineroar and who in my opinion also fits the role of it's inspiration dead on.
That would be the Professionial Wrestler Glenn Jacobs also known as Kane.
The first thing that comes into mind would be the similarities of their costumes and colours which tend to match up very well with each other in terms of colour and look very similar design wise.
The next thing to note is their build, pressence  and their heel status. Both Kane and Incineroar look massive in appearence due to their muscular structures and their intimidating pressence which makes them look monstorous in both height and intimidation levels (despite the fact that Incineroar is only 5'11 but it tends to look much more massive due to it's appearence).
Then there would be their monster-heel gimmick which makes them out to make both of them look monsterous strength-wise in a very similar fashion.
There is also the fact that Incineroar has been know to fight it's allies, this is another thing that Kane has done in the past. Back in 2003, Kane was forced to unmask for the first time, after doing so he went on a rampage which started by beating up his former tag partner RVD (Rob Van Dam) in a rather brutal fashion.
Even the Fire-Dark type matches up pretty well with Kane's character. Kane was a pyromaniac who would often set his opponents or other people ablaze such as Famous WWE commentator Jim Ross and even had a signature match known as an Inferno Match which ended with the opponent in flames. The Dark type could also be a possible link to the Fact that Kane is in Kayfabe ""the wrestling term for act"" the brother of The Undertaker.
Lastly, there is the kindness to children that is listed under Incineroar's bio and it is one of the more lesser parts of this theory but something that I think is still rather cool, Kane in the wrestling ring is known to be a monsterous heel who incrediblely violent and insanely strong but in the real world, the man who plays Kane, Glenn Jacobs is said to be one of the nicest people in the wrestling business. There is a story about him and Randy Orton which goes like this. Kane and a bunch of other wrestlers were eating at a diner at about 2003-05 and then a bunch of kids came up to Orton who wanted his autograph, Orton was rather rude to them and the kids became upset, Kane decided to be the nice guy and give the kids his autograph and told off Orton for being such a massive jerk.
I hope that this theory helps make Incineroar more interesting to other people and it was a lot of fun speculating about this, I not a wrestling fan and have barely watched any of it but was interested in the similarities that these two things had in common.
Thank you for reading this small little theory.

10821	"Regional Forms vs. Mega-Evolutions: A semi-brief analysis on their effects on gameplay."	"22"	"18"	"20161114"	"YabukiJoe"	"To recap at first, we knew that for numerous mega-evolutions, many Pokemon can change type (e.g. Mega-Charizard X or Mega-Gyarados) and/or gain new abilities (e.g. Mega-Kangaskhan, Mega-Pinsir). We also knew that all mega-evolutions had their base stat total increased by 100 compared to their original species. And even though mega-stones required the sacrifice of a hold item slot, and even though you could only mega-evolve one Pokemon per battle, they were still very much dominant in the metagames we saw since their introduction. 
However, I believe the new regional forms, as a concept overall, is more than just a gimmick. Basically, I see regional forms as a more meta-friendly version of mega-evolutions. The Alola forms we see here are still different in type, perhaps with an even more different change in typing than some mega-evolutions. We also see these regional forms get different abilities and movepools, just like the mega-evolutions, but all without the 100BST increase, which would appear to make regional forms more balanced while still having a concept that's ripe for further innovation. I also think they're different from split evolutions in that Alola forms, AFAIK, maintain the stat spread of their original forms, whereas a split evolution (e.g. Glaile vs. Froslass) can have different stat distributions (and as we know, Froslass is notably faster than Glaile). In summary, I like to think of Froslass and Glaile as being similar to how a pitcher plant will not actually grow its iconic pitcher if it is grown in nitrogen-rich soil, where as the regional forms are more like how there are vipers in both the continental US (in the form of Rattlesnakes) and in the tropics in South America, Australia, and so on. 
Overall, regional forms remind me of some real-world principles of evolution and speciation, and I think they have a lot of potential - in fact, I'd love it if there was a regional form of Flygon that more resembled an actual adult antlion.
EDIT: In addition to a correction in the comments that there are, in fact, no vipers in Australia, I have done some stat comparisons and have realized that Alola forms also have different stat distributions, though it appears these changes in stats are more minute than in split evolutions altogether. Alola-Dugtrio, in addition to gaining +20 Attack (as does the normal Dugtrio), gains 10 Defense and loses 10 Speed; Alola-Sandslash gains 10 Defense, 10 Sp.Def, and loses 20 Sp.Atk; Alola-Exeggutor gains 10 Attack and a loss of 10 Speed, plus an increase of 10 Sp.Def for both forms. 
Overall, I may plan to give a further analysis on when a Mega-Evolution, Regional Form, Split Evolution, or another Evolution is appropriate for buffing a Pokemon. In summary, it appears that Mega-Evolutions give a radical buff of 100BST, Regional Forms offer minute stat re-distributions while offering a consistent BST and possibly an entirely new type/movepool/ability, a typical evolution can offer a more modest increase in BST and less radical change in typing/ability, and a split evolution can give players another option for evolving a Pokemon without needing to capture a member of a different evolutionary line.

But its help didn't appear.
""That's alright, I thought. It will show up next time.""
It didn't show up next time. Or the third time. Or fourth. Or fifth.
This sad little cretin was screaming for help, an inch away from death, and nobody was coming to his aid. Ten times now he's called out. I thought perhaps that it was because of who he was. Munchlax is that weird little obese kid who eats garbage when he thinks nobody is looking, and none of the other schoolkids will talk to him because he smells like old cheese and wears Naruto headbands.
But no. I'm sure he has a friend somewhere, right?
Doesn't look like it... 11. 12. 13. 14.
It couldn't be true. GameFreak would never program in such a meanspirited thing, right? But then I remembered Guzma's Great Big House o' Child Abuse on the other side of Melemele Island. 
No. No, it can't be. I'm going to give it another chance.
15 times. Its help didn't appear. I can't bear this any longer. I'm about to just put it out of its misery, when finally, on its sixteenth try, another Munchlax shows up. And then on the seventeenth try, another Munchlax arrives!
And that's when I realized. It wasn't that Munchlax didn't have friends. It's that Munchlaxes have a Base Speed Stat of 5, and it simply takes them fifty turns to waddle their way into battle!
So for all of you who also want to collect a lot of Leftovers, just be patient; the Munchlaxes are working on their cardio.

/u/Presto03:
Touching the black area between Rotom's eyes will open the Pokedex.
/u/EXEmegaman: 
PSA If you want a good ditto for breeding they can be found on Mount Hokulani. They are annoying to chain but if you can bare it you can get your hands on a 3 IV+. Just snagged a 4 IV timid one myself.
/u/JustAShark22: 
The National Dex is coming with Poke Bank.
/u/_Tebro:
PSA: You can only evolve female Salandits. They only have I think a 10% chance to encounter a female. Also they evolve at lvl 33
/u/Furt_Wigglepants_II:
You can get unlimited premier balls at the thrifty megamart with that coupon and selling back the pokeballs. (buy ten balls get one premier ball free).
/u/Joecascio2000:
Try to avoid specifying levels and genders.
If you want a trade evolution, e.g. Gengar, put up a Haunter for a Haunter.
Put up starters for other starters.
Put up version exclusives, asking for other version exclusives.
Don't put up normal pokemon asking for legendaries. If anything, make sure they are at least a shiny pokemon.
If you suspect you received a hacked pokemon, be a bro and don't put it back into the system.
/u/frodoHS: 
PSA: The Bagon of Kala'e bay don't SOS Salamence, only ones on route 3. (According to Serebii and personal experience.)
/u/OGclip:
Run away from the berry pile Pokemon and it wont leave. Maybe enougth to encounter a shiny.
/u/CommanderRedJonkks:
In Festival Plaza the facility at the top of the construction worker's list (guy in the castle that lets you rearrange facilities) will be the facility your avatar offers to other players. Useful if you have facilities your friends want.
/u/Negrocuga:
I don't feel like making a new post but it seems like when breeding with 2 pokemon of the same species (have yet to test different non-ditto species) the offspring can be in either parents ball.
/u/KindergartenerOnLSD:
In the seafolk village pokemon centre, there is a tourist standing next to the magazine stand by the cafe part. he will challenge you to battle, and has a shiny exeggcute. after you beat him, he gives you six nuggets.
note: this may be after you become champion
/u/chillest1279: 
Route 8 Pokemon Center sells Quick Balls and Dusk Balls
/u/ShibbyDota:
When using Wondertrade, do it inside the castle and stand next to the right table. Your trade partner will spawn as a guest and will give you FP for trading with them.
/u/Heznarrt:
Kurt's pokeballs are available to be found on random routes
/u/GRMachiavelli:
if you look at a pokemon's summary page and hit Y it will change the chart on the top screen to show the pokemon's EVs, you will know if you have maxed a stat if it has sparkly stars on it.
/u/Musely:
Breeding Minior only gives you the parent's color.
/u/Jalen2612: (Layout)
/u/HappyDavin:
The Z Power of the Tapus are incredibly easy in the early stages of the game to get those hardy pokemon's health down for capture!
/u/jeikobuplays:
You can switch around the layout of the menu. If you press and hold, you will get the option to move it someplace else, and you just drag it to a spot.
/u/Axiddi:
If you don't feel like chasing a Wimpod around there's an easier way. On route 8 if you walk straight to the water, plow through the rocks, and then hop back on land and walk towards the wimpod it will run into you if you simply stand where it started.
/u/Lagao:
When you have high affection with your pokemon, you will start cheering for your pokemon and the other flair during battles will change. Sending them out, switching, dealing super effective damage, defeating opponents, waiting for a move...
/u/nyabbycat:
Avoid saving inside Pokemon Centers, as there is a chance that your character model won't load and the game will freeze when you boot it back up.

"When SM first leaked, I saw a lot of people talking about how males (and genderlesses) can now pass down balls when bred with a Ditto, but I hadn't seen anyone mention another new quirk: Males now have a chance of passing down their balls even when bred with a female.
I'm breeding a male Salandit in a Great Ball with a female Salandit in a Luxury Ball, and the offspring are randomly(?) inheriting one of either ball.
I'm sure I'm not the first person to find this out, by any means; I just know I was really confused when I started getting Great Ball babies, so I wanted to signal boost. That way, fewer people will be caught off guard -- especially if they're ball nuts, like I am.
Edit: To quote u/Slant_Juicy:

It's 50/50 if they're the same Pokemon, otherwise it's still always the female's ball. Also, male/genderless Pokemon can pass down balls via Ditto now, so that's cool.

10851	"[Sun/Moon] Easy (read: still not easy) way to get Razor Claw. WARNING: spoilers and a lot of text"	"16"	"20"	"20161128"	"Will_Matt"	"So  Sneasel evolves on level-up.
At night. 
While holding a Razor Claw. little pain in my butt
Currently, the only way to get a razor claw in SuMo is from the Jangmo-o line.
Serebii.net claims 5% chance of hold on Jangmo-o and Hakamo-o, and a 50% chance on Kommo-o. The only way to get the two evolved forms is through an SOS call on Jangmo-o, who himself is a 5% spawn chance in most outdoor parts of Poni Canyon. Nintendo really hates Weavile.
Anyways. Here's a relatively simple method I used to stall out an SOS fest. Here's an ingredients list:

Tapu Koko
TM40 Aerial Ace from Malie City PokeMart 
TM46 Thief from the Verdant Cavern/Normal Trial on Melemele Island (that Rock Smash part that you swore you'd come back to once you got Tauros but then forgot about)
TM 54 False Swipe from Kukui after completing the Melemele Grand Trial
Some Adrenaline Orbs 
Maybe some elixirs

First, get Tapu Koko and give him the following moveset:

Nature's Madness (automatically learned on capture)
Aerial Ace
Thief
False Swipe

Then, go to the Final Trial Site at the end of Vast Poni Canyon, and backtrack through the entrance of the cave. Keep backtracking until you get to the overhanging tree behind the Ace Trainer on the left; walk up to it and press A. In these patches of grass, you'll eventually find a Jangmo-o. Use False Swipe to get it low, and the Adrenaline Orb to make it call for help. Thief EVERYTHING that shows up. I got lucky and found a claw after about ~15 Hakamo-o. 
N.B. You don't technically need Tapu Koko specifically for this to work, but he makes it a lot easier. He is the only Fairy type that can learn both Thief and False Swipe. The Fairy typing is important because for the most part, the only offensive move involved here is Dragon Claw. The exception to this is if a level 41 or 42 Hakomo-o shows up (the level range is 41-44), it will know Headbutt instead of Dragon Claw, so be aware.

But there's a small inconsistency that bothers me everytime. Thus has to do with multiple instances involving the transitions from the poke pelago, festival plaza, and the ride Pokemon fly menu. When you go to the festival plaza, since it's desperate from the alola region itself, Rotom pops up and it's scren transitions to the festival plaza. But when you leave, there is no transition. Another example, when going to the poke pelago, you fly on a  charizard right? Then why do you just randomly re appear where you last were before the poke pelago. Small nitpicks but I guess I can handle it.
Tl;dr  when going to certain areas like poke pelago and festival plaza there is a transition to arrive there but not when going back.

An actual pure flying type pokemon (GEN5 cloud pokemon) will still become normal type upon using roost :/



My Setup:
My testing pokemon are a Moltres (that has roost and burn-up) and a Toucannon that has bullet seed and brick break.
Feel free to watch the video, or just read on if you cant/dont want to watch a video :)
Since I have neither a capture card, nor an N3DS, I had to record it the old-fashioned way.

First turn:
At first I use burn-up, so Moltres gets rid of its fire type. This will transform it into a pure flying type pokemon (until it leaves the battle field). Toucannon just roosts to waste its turn.
Second turn:
Then I use roost on a damaged Moltres, which heals its HP and gets rid of its flying type (until the end of the turn).
In the very same turn I use brick break on my own Moltres and the game does not say that it is very effective (if Moltres would turn into a normal type pokemon, like it used to be the case in GEN 5 & GEN 6, then it should have been very effective), it has regular effectivity.

While Curse has lost its ???-type, it seems that the game still knows what a ???-type is... at least internally.
This is a pretty cool interaction, since it means that a few pokemon can become typeless, if you know how (might require some hacking).

Can this be abused to have an offensive typeless attack?
You can use Typhlosion with Burn-Up to get a pokemon that has no type for the entirety of the fight. Now, if you hack it a few attacks it is usually unable to learn, would it be possible to have an offensive ???-typed attack?
Now I wonder, would it be possible to use an attack whose type depends on the pokemons typing (not including items, thus no Arceus/Silvally), thus you would have a ???-type pokemon use a ???-type attack?
Would this give the pokemon STAB, since its type(lessness) matches the attacks type(lessness)?

The goal: Collectively catch 100 million wild Pokemon. Pokemon received via trades, gifts, or egg hatching do not count towards the total.
How to participate: No, you do not need to sign up to the PGL to participate. You merely need to go to your castle in the Festival Plaza and log onto the PC on the right. From there you will receive your Global Link ID and can now participate in the mission. Speak to the receptionist above the PC. She will allow you to join the mission should you have a working internet connection. 
Signing up to the PGL does have its own benefit, though, which I'll outline below.

The prizes: 

If the mission is successful: 1000 Festival Coins
If the mission is not successful: 100 Festival Coins

Festival coins can be used in a variety of shops in the plaza, including shops that can level up Pokemon and help acquire rare items. The coins are well worth having.
There are additional prizes if you sign up for the PGL before tomorrow. Not only will you earn double the Festival Coins if you participate in the mission, but you will also receive either a Gold Bottle Cap or 2 Big Pearls, dependent on whether or not the mission was a success. These do not require participation in the mission, but participation is obviously necessary if you want to help towards the bigger prize.
Is this likely? Well, it depends. Right now I have seen no large groups pushing for the mission's success - all I've seen is how the mission is impossible. It is possible, but only if we come together as a community to make it happen. We're halfway through the mission so far and have only (publicly) hit 7% of the goal. But it's not too late to turn it around. 

Here is a list of just some of the things you can do whilst participating in the mission to make it worth your while regardless of the outcome:

Complete your Pokedex and earn that Shiny Charm!
Catch Pokemon so that you can find rare wild held items, like Thick Club, Light Clay, Light Ball, Stardust, etc. Earn lots of money by catching Staryu on Hano Beach, which often hold Stardust and Star Pieces.
Get enough Pokemon to upgrade your Poke Pelago.
Fill your boxes with Wonder Trade fodder!
Even if you don't want to make a dedicated effort, you could at least catch anything you came across organically with a Quick Ball!


Tips and Tricks:

The Quick Ball received a buff this generation, so is an excellent Poke Ball to use to catch lots of Pokemon.
/u/mamamia1001 pointed out that the Nest Ball is better than the Quick Ball for Pokemon under level 15, and is cheaper too at the Thrifty Mega Mart!


I'd like to propose an additional incentive. I'll be offering a legitimate 6IV Hidden Ability Mareanie with all of its available egg moves in any desired Poke Ball to anyone that catches at least 500 Pokemon for the event. Just post an image or some kind of proof of capture (you can check your running total with the aforementioned receptionist once you begin the mission). If 200,000 people took me up on that offer, the mission would be complete. (that's a lot of Mareanie!)
Good luck! Have fun with your captures. I'll be here to answer any questions. Spread the word.

TL;DR: -> Festival Plaza Castle -> PC -> Get Game Sync ID -> Right-hand receptionist -> Check -> Join -> GOTTA CATCH 'EM ALL -> Win prizes?

To claim these Pokemon, message the corresponding member. You need to send photographic proof of your capture total to the distributor. You can find out your total by checking the mission again with the receptionist on the right hand side of the Plaza's castle - this will display your capture total. Here's an example, courtesy of /u/GameWolfy. You may claim as many prizes as you are eligible for, but only one of each Pokemon (so, for instance, you cannot claim all 25 Vulpix from Atomic, or as many Mareanie as you like from me). 
Offers of hacked Pokemon are allowed, and are clearly noted. Some prizes are of limited quality - in these cases the first members to PM the distributor will win the prize

If you would like to add your own stake to incentivise the other members, send me a PM.
I'd like to thank all the members who have offered up incentives, and I'd like to wish you all a very happy December catchathon!

Amendment log:

EDIT1: TheBlack_Shadow is offering a chained Shiny Ditto to the member who catches the most Pokemon for the event. So get catching! I'll edit the post above with all of the extra stakes.
EDIT2: Updated Atomic786's incentive with extra prizes.
EDIT3: Amended the post to detail how to give proof and find out your capture totals. It's just above the 'member added stakes' list.
EDIT4: I used /u/ManualSearch's format for the incentives to make the post a bit more presentable. :) Thank you /u/ManualSearch! If your incentive was displayed incorrectly, shoot me a PM and I'll fix it.
EDIT5: Updated neroburnedrome's incentive. They're now offering Mimikyu to everyone rather than the first 30 winners.
EDIT6: Any Pokemon incentives offered at 1000 are now offered at 999 after the discovery that the in-game counter only goes up to 999. Currently trying to figure out a fair distribution method for Pokemon offered to the 'most caught' categories.
EDIT7: /u/Eriochroming has brought to light that we can check one another's totals in the Plaza. As such, photographic proof is no longer needed! Distributors will check the total upon trading. :)
EDIT8: Hmm, I think checking another person's total in the Plaza will list all Pokemon caught in a game, rather than just the Pokemon caught for the mission. As such, photographic proof is still required. Apparently there have been instances of Photoshopping totals going around. I have not come across anything suspicious, but other distributors should PM me if they do find something odd about proof given.


ANNOUNCEMENTS:

6th December: I've been blown away by the response! Thanks to everyone who has reached out to me so far! I'm trying to keep on top of everything, but if you want to get my attention just send me a PM! I've also had a couple of people questioning the legitimacy of my Mareanie. All of the offers above are legitimate (to my knowledge) unless clearly labeled otherwise. I'm painstakingly breeding these Mareanie myself, so don't worry about that! 
7th December: I'd like to mention that once the event has completed, I'll be posting a thread listing all of the incentives once more, along with a leaderboard of all participants. Please post your totals with proof once the event is completed. I'll edit this post with a link once we've reached the 13th December! EDIT: Link here.
9th December: 3 days left to go everybody! Let's go for that final push! :D As of this day I have had 40 Mareanie requests. That's 20,000 Pokemon! Amazing! I believe I am all caught up with the Mareanie requests. If you've sent me a message within the last 2 days but haven't gotten a response, send one again. There's been so much communication it's been hard to keep up!
10th December: This is what you're playing for - I'm not fooling!
11th December: We've reached the final stretch! I've had 80 Mareanie requests so far! That's 40,000 Pokemon caught for the event! I'm now up to date with Mareanie requests. :)

I kind of side tracked a little bit, starting off with Heart Gold and Soul Silver I decided that I was going to start soft reseting for shiny legendarys, so with my trusty 2DS and DS Lite at my side I started off with Luigia.   
Keep in mind I've timed my average reset to be 26 seconds from hitting the power button to seeing the sprite in battle so that means I can do about 133 resets per hour or 266 when using bot DS Systems, I spent 8 hours each day resteting. 
It's also worth nothing that certain Pokemon such as Kyogre, Groundon, Ho-oh and Luigia can only be caught in one version meaning they take a hell of a lot longer.
?
Day 1 - Shiny Luigia using 1 DS, Quiet Nature, Aprox. 7 hours = 931 resets. (Fucking lucky basically) 
?
Day 12 - Shiny Ho-oh Using 1 DS, Careful nature, Aprox. 95 hours = 12,635 resets.
?
Day 21 - Shiny Suicune using both DS, Modest Nature, Aprox. 68 Hours = 18,088 resets.
?
Day 37 - Shiny Mewtwo using both DS, Careful Nature, Aprox. 129 hours = 30,057 resets.
?
Day 81 - Shiny Groundon using 1 DS, Mild Nature, Aprox. 347 Hours = 46,151 resets.
?
Day 139 - Shiny Kyogre using 1 DS, Sassy Nature, Aprox. 413 Hours = 54,929 resets.
?
Day 156 - Shiny Rayquaza using both DS, Mild Nature, Aprox. 134 Hours = 54929 resets.  (Shout out to my friend Adam for lending me his Groudon and Kyogre from his HG/SS so I could do this one on both DS at once)
?
In summary that is a whopping 1,057 hours played, or 44 and a bit days, and 162,791 resets in total.
I will not be doing the roaming legendarys before you ask, although if anyone in the North West of the UK has an Arceus on a Gen IV game I'd be happy to borrow it and I'll try for those Legendary's from the Sinjoh Ruins. My Arceus is on my Omega Ruby :(

Bruxish is a 1% show in most of Ula'Ula fishing spots. Unless you are fishing a bubbling spot on route 15. Sooo.
I found that if you enter 15, take Lapras (NOT Sharkpedo) out to the bubble spot just north of the beach and fish. Then if you don't get Bruxish right away, turn around, exit south of 15. (South East if you want to be picky), turn around and re-enter and the first bubble spot respawns. 
You can then farm this bubble fishing spot over and over again without having to move forward and it turns a 1/100 chance of Bruxish showing up to a 1/5. WAY better odds. 
Does this also work in Moon at the same spot? Day or night?
Note: It worked for me in Sun version.

When I was a kid, I played Heartgold and Platinum for hours.  I used Action Replay for most of my pokemon, because I was a kid.  I just wanted my damn pokemon.  I spent years of my life researching it, learning everything I could.  When I was 12, I found pokemon Showdown during Black and White.  I got pretty good.  Won a couple of tournaments.  I got a bit bored, and stopped playing for a while.
Then X and Y came out.  I was once again swept up with Pokemon fever.  I beat the game, but never got really into it.  Same happened with Omega Ruby.  I EV trained some pokemon, beat my friends, but never really was captivated it.  I had lost that charm.
I'm now 17, and lined up to earn an Associates of Science in May.  I've ventured away from instant gratification.  I understand the value of the journey.  I beat Moon in 4 days.  Then, something else happened.  I was captivated by the game.  I spent 4 days and 150 eggs to breed a decent Wimpod.  The fire spread.  I bred more and more.  This was the first game where I bred a perfect 6IV pokemon.  I felt a happiness that I had never felt before in Pokemon.  I think it was because I finally feel like I earned my competitive Pokemon.  I set my eyes upon the dex, and went for it.  301 Pokemon later, I accomplished the goal.  The first Pokedex I have ever completed.  The satisfaction is incredible.  Sun and Moon have managed to do something no other game has ever done; it truly captivated my heart.
I hope this story did something for you.  What was your first Pokedex completion.
TL;DR Completed my first pokedex and I feel very satisfied.  Long time player, first time dexer.

(Not that the mobile connection requirement would be nearly as problematic now as it was back then.)

0 IV Attack: Hidden Power is Dragon, so get a Fairy-type Pokemon with Hidden Power, as Fairy-types are immune to Dragon attacks. Note that said Pokemon should have just immunity to Dragon attacks. 
0 IV Defence: Hidden Power is Dragon again, so follow the tips for 0 IV Attack and hope for the best. 
0 IV Sp. Atk: Hidden Power is Electric, so just get a Pokemon whose only immunity is Electric attacks. 
0 IV Sp. Def: Hidden Power is Steel, so get any Pokemon with a weakness to Steel and have them hold a Babiri Berry. 
0 IV HP: Yet again, Hidden Power is Dragon. You know the drill. 
0 IV Speed: Hidden Power is Ice, so get any Pokemon with a weakness to Ice, and have them hold a Yache Berry.

Just a few rules though:

They must have at least 1 starter pokemon (Pikachu and Eevee count, as well as if there were any others)
Limited to 1 legendary and 1 Pseudo-legendary
Does not need to be fully evolved, if Machoke fits them better than Machamp, then by all means put down Machoke. That said though,
Limit of 1 pokemon from a particular line. No 6 Machokes.
You don't need to include a legendary if it doesn't really match the character. (inb4 Jotaro with Buzzswole)
Limited to 1 Mega, due to obvious reasons.

Alright, with that out of the way, let's get this started!
Here's my representative: Hibiki Tachibana of Symphogear
Starter: Pikachu. They match very well together, Pickahu's ears/Hibiki's Headphones, all the yellow (although there was more yellow on Hibiki's armour in Seasons 1/2), and Hibiki has on a couple of occasions punched so hard thunder has appeared.
Legendary: Buzzswole (She ain't from JoJo and she doesn't have stand, this is allowed) So this doesn't match so much with her as it does with an enemy from Season 2 of Symphogear. An enemy that got stronger every time it ate stuff (sound familiar to an ability that rhymes with Bleast Bloost?) The monster did take after her a bit, so there is some connection there.
Wigglytuff. Symphogear is a show about a few things; mythology, fighting monsters, probable lesbians, and singing. Now, there's one thing you need to learn about Hibiki though, and that's that she'll end you if you dare to attack her friends, kind like a certain guild leader...
Lycanroc (Midnight Form): Look pretty similar? This happens a few times throughout Seasons 1 & 2. and the resemblance is there.
Snorlax: Every season shows at least 1 scene with Hibiki sleeping through class and eating more then anyone else (although that's true for probably 90% of anime protaganists)
Mega-Absol: So Absol is supposed to be a sign of incoming disaster, but instead everyone blames it for the disaster occurring. Kinda like a certain defining event of Hibiki's past. Also as the only one capable of mega-evolving, it takes the prize.
So there we go, let's see what everyone else can come up with.
Edit: anyone who brings up Cory in the House/Any non-anime from now on will be beaten like the dead horse they insist on beating.

I want to doubt that they'd let Eternal Floette go the way of the Spiky-Eared Pichu, but the only other thing left is to give it out in SM.

Pokemon you've caught at some point that you always transfer forward and feel attached to.
I mean, I've had a Raichu called BLITZ that I hatched before I finished Emerald. I've long since lost my first starter to the passage of time but I always remember BLITZ as the first Pokemon I had that I actually cared about. He's fought every Elite Four in every game I've owned and he's got 30 medals from several different games. His name irritates me because it's in all caps but I can't find the heart to just catch a new one and replace him. It's the same with a Zangoose I have called SCAR that I used to False Swipe Pokemon back in the day. I could replace them and a few others (including my first shiny that I caught during Easter; an exeggcute I called EASTER EGG) but they're as old as my love for the series is and that feels kinda special. 
I have about twenty Pokemon from various games (that I have kept for various different reasons) from over the last ten years that I always keep together in the 'besties box' and I would honestly release my entire Pokedex of 'mon before I gave them away.

"96"	"106"	"20170116"	"MankeyShank"	"My saltiest battle wasn't just a battle, but every battle I've had involving this one Pokemon. I'm the youngest of 3 brothers, and my oldest brother had Pokemon Sapphire. The middle brother had Ruby, and I had Emerald.
Anyway, my oldest brother had a Cradily in his team in Sapphire. Cradily became his favorite Pokemon next to Psyduck, and this is because his Cradily was the most tedious and frustrating Pokemon me and my middle brother have ever had to battle. Now if I had a Ghost-type on my team, that Cradily wouldn't be a problem, but I didn't. My brother's Cradily held a Leftovers, and it knew Ingrain, Confuse Ray, Stockpile, and Spit Up. My brother would have the Cradily use Ingrain, so it healed from both Ingrain and Leftovers and couldn't escape. Next, he would use Confuse Ray to confuse our Pokemon, use Stockpile a few times, then use Spit Up, KOing our Pokemon after they spent the last few turns hurting themselves in confusion. And once Spit Up ran out of PP, the Cradily couldn't attack, nor could it switch out due to Ingrain, so it just sat there, recovering HP and confusing our Pokemon which would lead to us just watching the dang thing use Struggle and slowly die (that is if our Pokemon hadn't fainted themselves in confusion or were KO'd by my brother's other Pokemon, which happened often). I think the only time my middle brother ever beat it was in a double battle and having a Salamence and Flygon gang up on it.
When my brother went to college, he let me start a new game in Sapphire as long as I traded his Cradily into my Emerald, which I did. Then one Summer, he wanted to play Sapphire again, and I gave him back his Cradily. We decided to battle, and to my horror (this was before flat battle rules, where levels would be evened out) he raised that Cradily to Level 100, and I got destroyed. While I have beaten that Level 100 botanical bulimic monstrosity several times (usually by spamming the shit out of Ice Beam, or putting a Dusclops on my team so Cradily couldn¡¦t attack), it was always a painstaking chore, especially if more than half of my team was massacred by my brother¡¦s Metagross, which would end up making resistance against his Cradily futile.
Battling that Cradily to me became the Pokemon equivalent to the Ganondorf challenge. That Cradily (named Audrey, after the plant from the Little Shop of Horrors) became a legend between me and my brothers.

10957	"[GUIDE] Pokemon Sun/Moon endgame leveling at Poni Gauntlet...who to use? I have a suggestion"	"27"	"33"	"20170116"	"triangleman83"	"So, I did some analysis and wanted to share my findings.  I'm doing a lot of leveling to finish my living dex and while my Decidueye can usually sweep anything there, I wanted to maximize my chances to one shot anything that shows up.  I haven't started crafting on grinding the League 5 yet and Poni Gauntlet is quick to get to and fairly safe.  Also it's not a huge time sink as you can leave any time if you want to go do something else or you want to swap out a pokemon who has evolved immediately.
Looking at the pokemon that can appear in the first grassy area south of Battle Tree, there are 6 that can show up:

Raticate
Golduck
Granbull
Pelipper
Gumshoos
Bewear

I plugged all 6 of them into a spreadsheet that I have which analyses weaknesses (with dual typing) and here is the result.  I highlighted the most effective types which will cover all 6 of these pokemon, Electric, Fighting, Steel. Then I went on a hunt for the best moves for these types.  Reliability is important when you're grinding, so I wanted 100% accuracy.  I also wanted to have them on TMs to make it easy to set up.  The moves I settled on were:

Flash Cannon - 80 power, 100 accuracy, SPA
Thunderbolt - 90 power, 100 accuracy, SPA
Brick Break - 75 power, 100 accuracy, ATK

Now, we have to find a pokemon who can learn all of those.  Cue the handy Serebii moveset searcher and the list is...well...short.  Smeargle is out of course because of his garbo stats, and almost all of the rest are not available without Pokebank.  There is one of them, however, that is available to everyone.  That pokemon is....Magearna.  With this handy dandy QR code, anybody who has access to Poni Gauntlet can get it.  Now, Magearna has pretty good base attack of 95 and special attack of 130.  Speed isn't great at 65 but we'll take care of that.  You'll get STAB with Flash Cannon too so that is nice.
One last thing to cover is a pesky guy known as Bewear.  He is vulnerable to Brick Break but there are 2 important things to remember though.  Brick Break is a physical attack and therefore is not hitting as hard.  Also, if Bewear has the Fluffy ability, Brick Break will only deal half damage.  I wanted a move that would address these 2 points and Dazzling Gleam fits the bill, making that to go to move for Bewear.  Since that is a STAB with Magearna as well, it should be plenty of power to knock it out.  

Dazzling Gleam - 80 power, 100 accuracy, SPA (non contact), STAB

I went with the Showdown suggested EVs and Nature of SPA and SPE with Hasty but Naive is probably just as good.  Choice Scarf is the item here since you will only ever be using that super-effective move in the fight and want to make sure to outspeed that wild pokemon.  Since you get 3 maxed IVs, you should hopefully get SPA and SPE along with that nature you want. Here's the full build in one helpful image.
This is my theory crafting that I think will work pretty well, but I haven't even redeemed my Magearna yet so I'm open to any suggestions.  Thanks for reading!

This naturally led to people believing it's somehow connected to a ""Pokemon following"" feature a la HGSS that was either scrapped during development or will be implemented in a future installment. But can we be this sure about it? I mean, I don't know the first thing about game design, but the first thing I noticed is that the models looked like they were rendered in a more polished, high-poly format that doesn't seem to me that it fits with the overworld. Plus, I'm not sure how they would implement such a feature with the nightmarish scaling issues and very possible lag with the bigger mons.
What then do I think these models are for? It's hard to say, my guess is no better than anyone else's, but I think it's unwise to automatically assume without a shadow of a doubt that it must have to do with a feature that's been dead for 3 generations and would likely be a pain to translate to 3D.

"So I'm working on a little tabletop project and my OCD desires that I make everything as accurate to the games as possible (with the exception of a few improvements/changes).

I know that at certain levels of affection your Pokemon get bonuses on top of an experience boost, such as the occasional autoheal of a status, an increased critical hit rate, and the ability to dodge and survive attacks.
The problem I'm having is that evidently nobody, not even Bulbapedia, knows the % rates for these effects or if they increase with affection level. Did seriously nobody think/care to look into this? I mean it's gotta be in the code somewhere, which we've definitely got mined and deciphered by now, right?

11012	"I did a ton of calculations to find the best type combos! [Excel required] [Spoiler: It's Steel/Fairy]"	"250"	"169"	"20161024"	"danatron1"	"Download link for excel document: http://www.mediafire.com/file/t6w17nbemthl9k4/PokemonTypeExcel.xlsx
I decided to make this to see which type combination was the best all round. I'm not the best one to interpret this data, just create it. There are some aspects that aren't very well represented, such as the varied move pool of Normal types, or the status shenanigans of Grass.
This is all based off a type chart. This compares type matchups and type matchups only. Please note that it's all in dual-type format, so when the chart reads ""Fire/Fire"" for example, the data is representing a single type, not dual type. Here's my methods of creation:
For defensive capabilities, I calculated how every possible type combination's response to a move of every possible type. For single types this was easy; Ground for example would get +1 against normal, +2 against water, +0 against electric and +0.5 against poison. Doing this for each type resulted in the number 19, with lower being better obviously. (18 would be the baseline, due to there being 18 types, and this would be the score something got if it wasn't weak/resistant to anything). I then turned these into 'scores' by calculating how far it was from 18, so ground would get a score of -1. This set 0 as the baseline and made higher = better the standard for every following calculation. Steel resists many attacks, so achieved the highest defensive score of 3, and Ice scored the lowest, being fragile as it is, at -3.5.
For dual types it got a bit more interesting. I calculated the response to every type attack taking into account the dual type. Since Flying and Bug both resist Fighting, a flying/bug type would get a score of 0.25 from a fighting type. It would also receive a score of 4 from rock types, as rock type moves would be 4x effective against them. These scores were then added up, and once again converted into 'score' format. Ice/rock, a very fragile combination, totaled 26, which is 8 above 18, so it's defensive score was -8.
Offensive capabilities are harder to calculate, as pokemon frequently have move types that don't match their type, however for the sake of calculating potential offence capabilities. Since there aren't dual-type moves, pokemon are assumed to have at least 1 damaging move that matches their type, and the player has the ability to pick between them. This means that a fire/fighting type for example would be able to get a super effective hit on a rock type. Despite fire being 0.5x effective against it, fighting is 2x effective, so it's assumed the player would choose the most appropriate move for the job. Against something like ice, where both move types are 2x effective, they still only receive 2 points for that, as you can't have a 4x effective move against a single type.
After grading each pokemon's attack potential with a score, I added them up for an overall combined score. The results are here:
Best type combinations overall:


Type
Score



Steel/Fairy
9.75


Flying/Steel
9.5


Ground/Steel
9.25


Ghost/Steel
8.75


Fighting/Steel
8.5


Ground/Fairy
8


Water/Steel
8


As you can see, steel's defensive abilities are topping the charts here. Shoutout to Empoleon for being the best starter, and Ground/Fairy for being the best glass cannon. Since the 'top defensive' list is near identical to the best combined list, I'll skip straight to best attackers:
Most offensive type combinations:


Type
Offence score



Ice/Ground
9


Ice/Fighting
9


Ground/Fairy
8


Fire/Ground
8


Ground/Flying
8


Fighting/Flying
8


Fighting/Rock
8


Now the list looks very different. While the best of both worlds steel/fairy was 4.75/5, the ones with the best offence are sitting in minus numbers for defense. If you want the ability to land super effective shots against the most types possible, you'll be sacrificing defense for it. While Ice and ground are fragile types, they do have the super effective capabilities to make up for it.
Most fragile type combinations:


Type
Defense score



Ice/Rock
-8


Grass/Ice
-7


Grass/Bug
-7


Ice/Bug
-6.5


Ground/Rock
-6.25


The most fragile thing in the universe: an icy rock. This right here is why obamasnow needed a mega. Kinda fun to look at just how squishy some of these type combos can be.
The worst at everything awards:


Type
Score



Grass
-3.5


Grass/Bug
-3


Grass/Ice
-2


Psychic
-2


Bug
-2


Normal
-2


Grass/Dragon
-1.75


Ice/Rock
-1.5


Ice/rock and Ice/grass are of course back on this list. Singular types suffer here because the way I calculated attacks assumed they had a less diverse move pool. This also should be taken with a grain pillar of salt, as the shenanigan abilities of grass/psychic don't show through here, and normal has a very diverse move pool. In my opinion though, bug still belongs here. Grass/Bug makes for Stealth B levels of awful glass cannon.
And that's what I got out of this excel nightmare. In a game of nothing but type matchups, this would define the best and worst, although in the world of pokemon, this is only a piece of the puzzle. If you have the software, I urge you to download the full spreadsheet and have a poke around for yourself; All the calculations I did are in there, so while they should be all correct, you'll be able to see if I made any mistakes and where. I hope this'll be helpful to you!

I am going through and rebuilding my living dex with the SM ""+"", getting all the Pokemon hatched or caught. I was breeding deerling, and thinking why do we only have access to the one season? I loved going through my White version with a SAWSbuck that changed form, but missed the Winter form. It just looks so regal!
So it got me thinking, We have many location based evolutions throughout this game (Here's looking at you Vikavolt...) but why don't we have location based hatching too? At least with the pokemon that already have different forms? 
Deerling has been stuck in it's spring form for the past 2 generations. Why didn't they have location based hatching?
Deerling hatches in the Ice Cave -> Winter
Deerling hatches in the Desert -> Summer
Deerling hatches in the Overworld Rain -> Autumn
Deerling hatches anywhere else -> Spring
I  know that there are others, I am just really tired and can't think of any others,  so who else should have their forms change based on hatching location?

He has the boldere but I have the gigalith! here are 2 images showing both of them. http://imgur.com/a/N3b2G!
If someone want to try it, here is some important info that maybe is necessary:

Both of us have Moon version.
The cloned pokemon is the one of the person that proposed the trade and the one who lost the connection.
The pokemon cloned evolve when trading.
The other pokemon was a bulbasaur (now he is lost)
In game language is Spanish for both.

If someone want more info just ask, we can't take a photo from both consoles right now.

Got Protect 6 times in a row? Believe it or not, it's happened. I'm interested in the wild luck that you've run into.
The reason I bring this up is because of something I just remembered: My SoulSilver cartridge. Now, the lucky thing here didn't happen IN the game; it happened to the game.
Basically... I left the game in my jacket pocket by accident and it ended up going in the wash. I freaked the fuck out when I realized it and tried getting it to work with desperation. Eventually, I got to a blue screen saying the game couldn't respond, so I had to call it quits and go to sleep.
The next day, I saw the game on my dresser and decided to try again. After a couple of attempts, it appeared on the home menu. I clicked in.
Bells chimed.
Lugia appeared before me.
By some miracle, the cartridge dried off. My battle with Red wasn't false history. I felt like crying, and I probably did.
tl;dr by some miracle SoulSilver survived a trip to the washing machine.

Randomon Royal is a passion project I¡¦ve been developing for the last few months that will help in managing randomized teams in Pokemon Sun and Moon. It was originally developed for the new Battle Royal mode; you can set up four teams with random Pokemon and shuffle Abilities (special rules). Once the teams are set, you can go breed or catch ¡¥em in-game and start the Battle Royal! Features:

Abilities. Set and follow special instructions to spice up the standard battle process!
Customize and share. Create your own Abilities and save the set to be used by others!
Filters. You can set global filters to limit what Pokemon will be picked. You can also set unique filters for each team, allowing for settings such as Fire-types vs Water-types!
Edit. Evolve, devolve, trade, or change the held items of Pokemon with a few simple clicks!
Documentation. With a comprehensive guide and mouseover tips, you¡¦ll be a master Battle Royal organizer in no time!
Themes. Change the backgrounds to your liking! Currently features four themes with more are on the way.
Active dev. Contact me anytime in this thread or on my developer blog with feedback, suggestions, or bug reports ¡V I¡¦ll be happy to help.

Thank you for checking out my work. I am eager to hear what people think!

Whether you run, it runs, or it gets KO'd, it will always respawn once you leave the area. Usually you have to leave the area and come back multiple times for it to reappear, but it will eventually be there waiting for you. Sometimes it may take 3 tries, others maybe 10, you just have to keep trying.

In fact, I'd say that Torracat has quickly become one of my favorite pokemon. I was disappointed by Incineroar's design, but it wasn't the end of the world, and I was willing to just deal with it. 
But today my Torracat evolved, and I read Incineroar's pokedex entry: This Pokemon has a violent, selfish disposition. If it's not in the mood to listen, it will ignore its Trainer's orders with complete nonchalance.
What happened to my starter? Starters are supposed to be your best friends, through thick and thin, at your side throughout your pokemon journey. Maybe I'm being too sensitive here, but the idea of the pokemon that's been by my side the entire game turning into a selfish creature that won't listen to me and is sometimes so violent that it attacks other trainers is unacceptable. What happened to love and friendship, core elements of the pokemon franchise? It wouldn't bother me so much if Incineroar was a non-starter pokemon, because pokemon come in all varieties and personalities, and I think it's important to show some diversity in the different species. But for a starter to become selfish, violent, and dismissive of it's trainer seems to undermine the bond between people and pokemon that the game has been trying to convey for 20 odd years. 
I've just shut my 3ds off, even though it means losing about an hour of battling and catching pokemon. I'm keeping my friend and companion Torracat exactly as he is. Does anyone else feel this way?

I want to use our sticky thread space to promote more community conversation on /r/pokemon, and I'm looking for suggestions about ways we can design fun threads that you'd visit the subreddit to see.

I'm looking for suggestions for two kinds of threads:
Weekly challenges: Small yet substantial tasks that anyone who's reached the postgame in a recent main series Pokemon game could complete in a few hours. Think stuff like defeating the Elite Four with a team of just normal types, competing for time going down the Hoenn Cycling Road, or defeating opponents in online battles with certain conditions attached. If we implemented this, then a new weekly challenge thread would be posted at the beginning of each week, and people could check in to discuss progress in the comments as they went.
Themed discussions: /r/pokemon used to post these several times a week, but we gave it up because I ran out of ideas the community moved in a different direction. Themed discussions ask specific, open-ended questions allowing for creative answers that are fun to both devise and read. Think stuff like asking people to design their own gym or their own item, narrate the closest battle they ever had, or devise Pokemon teams for famous athletes. If we implemented this, a couple of these threads would be posted throughout the week in addition to the weekly challenge.

Please post suggestions for weekly challenges and themed discussions in the comments below! If we get some good ideas, we'll include them in the project, with credit to the users who suggest them. Either way, expect more details in April about things we're doing to try and ramp up opportunities for discussion and participation on this subreddit :)

Tieing this with recent news of Game Freak hiring for a RPG franchise I was left wondering the following.
To those of us who played Pokemon X and Y we remember that certain areas were not explorable and in Pokemon Sun and Moon we see certain construction places where there a thing to be build.
I believe they did that intentional so they could release a multi-region game where they would connect Kalos and Alola. I believe this to be somewhat true because X and Y was """"""spiritual"""""" successor to 1st generation and Sun and Moon """"""spiritual"""""" successor to 2nd generation. However due to technical limitations that was present at Nintendo 3DS kept them away to do what they had wished to do. 
Another reason why I believe this is to be true is that the fact that they said that the job offer was due to May/March of 2018. To that I say Hoora! Because that means they have probably ""scraped"" Pokemon 3DS engine and decided to build Pokemon from scratch to be more fitting for a home console that is also a portable beast
TL;DR : Next game is Pokemon Z-Stars which will feature 2 areas (Kalos and Alola) on Switch (beacuse power of Switch > 3DS)

Type: Dark
Puzzle Gym
In my gym, you'd walk in, and see everything bright, with the guy, and the two statues on the side. There is also a door in the centre. When you go through it, you will pause, and suddenly the lights will go out. You can still see, but not good. You will have to walk around in a dark maze. You will eventually get to a dead end, and there will be a trainer there that you will have to battle. After you beat the trainer, the lights will turn on, and you go over to the next door, and can open it. The lights will go off again, and you will have to repeat. And then again. After you go through the third door, you will go up a long staircase, and at the top, there is a platform with me standing there. Waiting for the next challenger. 
I will say ""Oh, hi! I didn't see you there! But, I thought a new challenger was approaching, because my Umbreon kept acting odd. Anyways, you ready? Because I am."" Then, the battle will start.
The trainers have two to three Pokemon. Mostly Crawdaunt, Liepard, Pawniard, and Mandibuzz. First on will be a Punk Guy, second will be a Punk Girl, and the final will be a double battle against a Punk Couple.
My Pokemon will be an Umbreon, a Krookodile, a Scrafty, a Malamar, and my ace, Sableye.
Umbreon will have the ability Inner Focus, and the moves Snarl, Moonlight, Confuse Ray, and Crunch.
Krookodile will have the ability Moxie, and the moves Power Trip, Bulk Up, Earthquake, and Crunch.
Scrafty will have the ability Intimidate, and the moves Swagger, High Jump Kick, Crunch, and Facade, as well as holding a Toxic Orb.
Malamar will have the ability Contrary, and the moves Topsy-Turvy, Superpower, Hypnosis and Foul Play, as well as holding a Sitrus Berry.
Sableye will have the ability Prankster, and the moves Swagger, Punishment, Shadow Claw, and Sucker Punch, as well holding a Sablenite.
For beating the gym, you will get the Foul Badge, and the TM for Crunch.
I will say ""Well, phooie. I lost. You only got one more gym left, right? Well, what are you doing? Get going! Oh, first take the Foul Badge! And this TM! NOW, get going!

Had my 3ds in a fanny pack, and put it down on top of my friends and I luggage while I went to go check in and they watched the luggage. Later that night in the room I realize the fanny pack is missing.
So I search the room, search the car, search the lobby, report it, they say they never got anyone returning it. I think either its stolen or I left it at home an imagined bringing it into the building. I just got home and its not there.
Luckily not all my games where in that... but my new 3ds, all more 3ds pokemon games, DQ8, Hyrule warriors, and 1 or 2 others are now lost forever. 6 years or work, a bunch of shinies, perfect breed pokemon, rare event only pokemon, hours and hours of my life totally wasted and lost because some ass decides to swipe a bag in a hotel lobby(also I heard that multiple people had things stolen too)
So now I have no idea what to do... any motivation I had for this series is completely gone. Would I be justified in using hacking to get everything I once had back? Would people even care? Should I even bother if Nintendo may just brick my old 3ds I still have if I tried to do this...

11209	"How would you feel about receiving the mascot legendary early in the game?"	"5"	"21"	"20170403"	"RomanoffBlitzerGlitch researcher - OLDEN WutFace"	"One of the problems I've always had with mascot legendaries is that they always appear very late in the game. By then, you've already built up a solid team that you've bonded with, and now, you either have to replace one of them or ignore the legendary altogether.
To counter this, how about the legendary appearing early in the game? That way, you can more easily build your team around the legendary, and you can more easily bond with it. Nebby was Nintendo's first attempt at this idea, being around for most of the game, but ""early mascot legendary"" would be an even stronger idea if you personally trained and bonded with it.
There are a few potential problems with this concept, but I think these can be addressed. Some may think would make the game too easy; this could be remedied by making the legendary underleveled compared to the point in the game that you receive it (so that its naturally high stats are balanced out), or it could be initially received in a weaker form (like Cosmog, except actually usable in battle). Others might find it hard to keep a Pokemon plot relevant once it enters your team, since it can be boxed, traded, or released, but trading and releasing can be prevented by the game, and it can be dragged out of the box for certain cutscenes.
What do you think?

As the title may have revealed, I'd love to see how many people actually use region specific competitive teams, and if so, what those teams look like. Building a competitive team while restricting yourself to a certain region makes playing competitively much harder, but in my opinion also much more rewarding when you do it right. I wouldn't have started this thread if I didn't use region specific competitive teams myself, so I'll kick this off :)

11216	"Would anyone else prefer a Black and White sequel instead of a remake?"	"12"	"7"	"20170403"	"Obilitysharp"	"I know it's not confirmed they will make one but assuming they will, I would much rather they make a sequel instead of remake a game that already has two parts and the potential for a sequel. No point of redoing an already great story. I think the sequel would probably have you as maybe a new trainer who some how gets him self tangled with a new evil team (possibly plasma) that wants to revive the original dragon for either a good but bad reason or just plain evil reason and somewhere in that Hilda/Hilbert and Nate/Rosa get involved since iirc they both canonically own the legendaries. I'm not too sure about Nate/Rosa owning the legendaries because I think that was post game but I still consider i canon. Some where in the story you are going to have to capture Kyruem to protect it and some where in the story you still end up fighting the dragon in some new type of battle system that won't make you cry as it sweeps your team. Possibly a final fantasy style 2/3/4 vs 1 kinda like horde or did battles.
If they did a remake they would probably just do a mega legendaries that again would become the meta because of broken they are. Main reason I don't want a remake is because I swear they won't put in the features from BW 2 and also since it's a sequel, they would probably only remake BW 1. Also the original dragon should not be catchable if it comes into existence but it could either take like 3 spaces up in your party or become a z move like a taoium z for the trio.
I think if they keep and refine the features from BW AND BW2 and make a great story, it could become the best Pokemon game of all time.

11221	"What is your least favorite Kalos Pokemon?"	"1"	"45"	"20170403"	"purplekiren"	"Kalos had some good designs, but overall, they didn't make me go ""Damn, this is an amazing bunch of Pokemon."" Sure, I really like quite a few (Volcanion, Dragalge, Gourgeist, and Heliolisk to name a few), but a lot just aren't that notable to me. Only having 72 Pokemon didn't help either. I get that quality over quantity is a popular mindset, but if you shoot a basketball 100 times, you're gonna get more hits then if you only shot 70 times, even if there might be a higher percentage of hits in those 70 times. And I don't buy ""They need more time for coming up with good designs!"" when Gen V (my favorite set of new Pokemon) had 156 of them, which is more than twice as much.
Ranting aside, Dedenne is easily (in my opinion) the least inspired, worst designed, least impressive Pikachu clone. There's no reason it couldn't have a BST of 475 or so (even Komala, a weak looking Pokemon, has a BST of 485), but no. It has to be weak and a poor excuse for a Fairy type. I get that it represents the new gimmick, but others did it better. Plusle and Minun are good Doubles partners, Emolga is only found in rustling grass, those show the new things of that Gen. But Dedenne isn't even a weird take/inversion of how Fairy types play or a perfect representative of the Fairy type's role in the metagame. It just is one. Dedenne is my least favorite Kalos Pokemon.

Ill be honest.. the picture could be better but my hands were super shaky due to extreme joy that it was finally over so the phone blurred it at the last second. At least its good enough to show the general fact, just gotta squint at Beldums name a bit. 
Now I can honestly say I pulled the impossible off and  got the picture to prove it( even if the quality is complete crap ). Might wonder trade a crap ton of eggs bred from it so at least theres some legit ones up there for others to get ahold of.
Just look out for my specific trainer info on the pokemon if you want to be 100% sure it isn't genned/cheated. Hope that at least makes all this effort worth it in the long run for everyone else because im not sure this was worth the ungodly stress it caused me to do.

Since this is a Pokemon-related subreddit I thought you might like some of the stories from /r/newbarktown. So here I give you ""The story of Eldmullvad"" and the first chapter of ""Fake Silver"".
.
The story of Eldmullvad:
In 2009 or 2010 I got Pokemon Heartgold. It was my first own Pokemon game. I had borrowed a friend's game before but now I had my own.
The game I had borrowed was Diamond and I didn't go through the beginning, my friend did it for me, so this was the first time I really chose a Pokemon. I looked through all three and I knew which one I wanted. Cyndaquil.
I gave it the nickname Eldmullvad, which basically means Fire Mole, because I thought he looked like a mole.
We went on our mission to Mr. Pokemon's house and we met Professor Oak. I didn't like Professor Oak for some reason. But I got a Pokedex I never used.
We fought the first gym, the second, had a hard time beating the third but we did it. After some time we had beaten all the 8 gyms of Johto. We felt like real winners. Then the Elite Four came. They were hard. But we finally beat them, too. And then I found out we also had to battle the Champion. After a long while we beat Lance, too.
When we got to Kanto we really felt like we would beat all gyms the same day. We were wrong. But in the end we beat them. Eldmullvad was really strong. When we were done we continued to explore the two regions and battle the Elite Four.
There was a week when Eldmullvad was in level 90-something. I spent that week battling the Leauge over and over. If I knew what Rare Candies were and that I probably had some, I would probably use them. But I didn't, so I got Eldmullvad to Level 100 by fighting, only.
That was a happy day, the day he got to Level 100. I really loved my Pokemon and he loved me back. I miss Eldmullvad.
I had started playing Pearl and had traded Pokemon with myself a number of times. One day I wanted to restart Pearl. I had forgot that Eldmullvad was in it. So I restarted it and a long time afterwards I understood that I had killed Eldmullvad.
My first real Pokemon.
.
Fake Silver:
Yesterday I bought a copy of Pokemon Silver. Only that I didn't. It wasn't really Pokemon Silver, it's some kind of ""fake"" Pokemon Silver. It seems to be a bad fan translation with a lot of language errors and I'm thinking about posting my story as I create it here.
So, here's my fake Silver story:
I pressed ""NEW GAME"" and Professor Oak's intro begins. It's full of errors and I find it a bit funny.
""Welcome to here!Before you play, I need to know the time! What hour?""
I put in 3H.
""So! AN 3H""
I pressed ""YES"".
""How long past?""
I put in 58 MN and laughed a little about their choice of words.
""AN 3H58 MN. now sure?""
""Welcome to the world of PKMN! I am OAK! People call me the PKMN PROF!The world is inhabited by PKMN This one is MARILL!I like to study PKMN!I do it as my job!I love them!My friend PROF UTSUGI will you a PKMN!but I will help dury your journey so What is your name?Are""
I now got to choose between ""NEW NAM"", ""GOLD"", ""HIR"", ""TIK"" and ""OLD"". I chose NEW NAM.
I just saw some kind of message in the ""keyboard"". It says ""HC TRANSLATIONS VERSION 1.0"". After writing this intro I will look up that name.
I chose ""tsd"" as my name, after my username.
The intro continued: ""tsd! you ready Your very own PKMN adventure is aboutto unfold Good luck, I hope you manage catch all PKMN!""
End of intro.

Just wanted to share a project I'm working on. I started it a while back, and it is coming along nicely.
It's essentially an app that lists the Pokemon by the route they can be found, and allows you to check them off. It checks of duplicate mons automatically, and you can save it locally to your device.
You can check out the current progress here: https://giacomolaw.github.io/pokefinder/
The project is also open source, and you can find the code here: https://github.com/GiacomoLaw/pokefinder
If any of you know JS, I'd really appreciate if you helped out a little. To get the Pokemon checked off, I need to add a checker for every mon, and it takes ages to add. I'd really appreciate if you helped out my adding any missing mons here: https://github.com/GiacomoLaw/pokefinder/blob/master/js/checkbox.js
What do you think of it currently, and any improvements you want?
Thanks!

"14"	"28"	"20170424"	"MackBuskFerrofriend"	"We all know that there are Pokemon out there that would benefit to some changes to make them more relevant to different aspects of the game, or just logically would make more sense.
Some classic examples are that many would like to see a dragon-typing to go with Charizard's fire-typing, or Gyarados' water-typing. Or Kangaskhan a baby-stage instead of being a mother when born.
I feel like they have missed a couple of basic things, i.e giving Ferrothorn the move 'Spiky Shield', just like they didn't let Sudowoodo have the move 'Head Smash' to go with his rock-typing and ability 'Rock Head' until the latest generation.
Some other small changes I'd like to see them add for the sake of making mons more relevant to the competitive scene are:
- Giving Kabutops and Aerodactyl the move 'Accelerock', which would make a lot of sense since they're very fast despite being rock-types.
- Change Rapidash's HA to 'Speed Boost', and Starmies' HA to 'Dazzling'.
Now, I understand that there probably are good reasons for some things to be as they are, like the Dragon-typing to Gyarados or Charizard. Dragonite is, after all, a psuedo. Dragons are supposed to be special etc.
What do you guys think? What would you change?

As of right now Run Away ensures escaping from a wild Pokemon battle and Illuminate increases the chances of running into a wild encounter, but both abilities don't do anything in battle. I'm surprised that four generations later Game Freak still hasn't thought of giving these abilities something in a battle. Even Stench, which did absolutely nothing in battle back in the day, got a buff and now has the chance of flinching the foe. 
So what I would suggest that Run Away allows the user to switch out regardless of the situation (Shadow Tag, Arena Trap, Sticky Web, etc) and Illuminate should give the user a 30% accuracy boost, like Compound Eyes; the user is lighting up their surroundings so why not? 
There are other abilities I thought of that could use a boost such as Anticipation where instead of shuddering, the user would reveal which move it shuddered to.
Anyways I'd love to hear your guys' thoughts and suggestions for other abilities that could use some boost.

Ethan would have his team from the manga, Ambipom, Typhlosion, Sunflora, Sudowoodo, and Togekiss. However, there's still a spot for one of three Pokemon, Politoed, Tyranitar, or Hitmontop. Lyra has a Marill in the anime and manga as well as in the games, where at one point she mentions it evolves. Her starter would be Chikorita also. The final team, in my opinion, would be Azumarill, Girafarig, Meganium, Furret, Ledian, and possibly Gliscor.
Brendan would either have chosen Treecko (promotional art, ORAS trailer) or Mudkip (manga). May definitely has Torchic, no doubt. There are many ways you could go with Brendan and May's teams. Perhaps some of the Pokemon they have in the manga, or take into account Gen 3's many duos, which can be split among Brendan and May. These include Plusle/Minun, Dustox/Beautifly, Salamence/Metagross, and Camerupt/Sharpedo. Alternatively, one of them could have their team if they are the player's rival. 
With Lucas as the player character, choosing Turtwig would give Barry Chimchar and Dawn Piplup. Looking to the manga for potential Pokemon, Dawn has a Lopunny, Froslass, Cherrim, and Pachirisu. She had a Mamoswine she gave away to Lucas. Speaking of Lucas, he has a Munchlax, Bastiodon, Lickilicky, and Fan Rotom. He borrowed a Drifblim at one point. Perhaps Pokemon they could have are a few of the massive assortment of cross-generational evolutions from Gen 4. Aside from those, possibly Lucario, Chatot, and others, like the regional mammal, bird, or bug.

Pokemon Emerald is probably my favorite game in the series, it's definitely my most-played. My favorite thing to do is make theme-based teams to both make the game more challenging, while also making me use mons I would never usually use. It's really fun and I definitely suggest you guys try it out! Some example teams I've done include a Water Gym Leader team consisting of all water types, and most recently, a monochromatic green team. This playthrough's theme is a monochromatic black team. I chose Mudkip as my starter to help me along the rough beginnings, and caught a Poochyena and a Silcoon and am currently grinding them up.
OKAY, HERE IT GOES. So, Poochyena SUCKSSSS so much early game. I thought its impish nature would make it a bit more viable but it literally makes no difference when you're trying to grind from level 3. I opted to catch a Silcoon rather than gamble with a Wurmple, only to raise the Wurmple up to level 7 and have it evolve into a Cascoon, which wouldn't fit the theme. I figured it would save time in the end to just catch a Silcoon (which max out at level 5 in the wild) and go from there. So I've spent the last two hours using a piss poor Poochyena (not it's nickname, but it's in the conversation now) as the muscle to switch-train a Silcoon, which only knows Harden.
But, I've trudged along and made good progress. Poochyena is lv 10, Silcoon Lv 9, and Mudkip lv 9. I'm on the route just north of Rustboro. I'm facing the Youngster with a lv 9 Machop, knowing it would be a tough battle, but would yield the largest chunk of exp to date. I send out Silcoon, and switch into Mudkip, knowing the Machop has Low Kick. Machop sets up a Focus Energy, Mudkip hits it with a few Mud-Slaps, then two Tackles, before going down to a crit. Machop is at about half-HP. I send in Piss Poor Pooch knowing it's an uphill battle, and whiting out is very possible. Pooch MISSES his first Tackle, but dodges a Low Kick. Okay, good. It lands two Tackles, the Machop setting up two unnecessary Leers, which is the equivalent of it flexing it's calf muscles at Pooch, knowing what's to come. Machop is down to very-low red. If Pooch can land just one Tackle, we can wi--IT MISSES THE TACKLE AGAIN, Machop Low Kicks Pooch so hard it basically vaporizes into a cloud of fur and inadequacy. 
So, here we are. A battered, crippled Machop, trying to rub mud out of its eyes, versus my on-the-brink-of-finally-becoming-kind-of-good Silcoon. I'm so sick of the hax that I just want to white out and grind in the woods. I mash the A button, fully accepting my fate, and just try to focus on watching spoiled couples fight about the hue of white subway-tile backsplash on Property Brothers. A few minutes go by, and I look down at my scarlet SP, surprised to see Silcoon not only alive, but at full health. Machop has apparently missed Low Kicks while also trying to set up Leers, as Silcoon just sits there Hardening. Harden has 30 max PP, but is currently at 12.
...Fuck it, I say to myself. 
I decide to keep on Hardening, with the idea to Struggle Machop into submission, and let Silcoon earn all the exp that's coming to her. But just as I decide this, Machop dips his face in the nearby sea and washes the dirt from his eyes because he lands two Low Kicks in succession, both crits. Silcoon barely is at half HP. A few more Leer/Harden rounds go by. Finally--finally--Harden runs out of PP, and I get off the Struggle. The battle has finally en--MACHOP EATS THE STRUGGLE. Silcoon is at 9 HP, Machop, is basically leaning on the tall grass to stay upright. Low Kick, CRIT, SHIT, FUCK, SILCOON DOESN'T CARE, LIVES ON 2 HP, GETS OFF STRUGGLE, RECOIL BRINGS SILCOON TO 1 HP, AND TAKES OUT THE MACHOP. 
Dust settles. A bead of sweat trickles down my forehead. Silcoon gains all of the exp, enough to reach level 10, and subsequently transforms it into the harbinger of destruction it was destined to become. I now own an innocuously vicious Beautifly.
To be continued... Thank you for reading/enduring/experiencing.
TL;DR: Silcoon with only Harden struggles to defy all odds and knock out an obviously-juicing Machop. By the grace of Arceus, Silcoon realizes its potential.

--WARNING--
The pokemon you get using this method may not be considered as ""legitimately obtained"" (even if the pokemon itself was captured via legitimate means), so please take caution when using.

Okay, I know some people have made guides for this already, but getting multiple shinies using this method is a tad bit easier than most of the ones I've seen (especially for Red and Blue), and most of them are either one-time use and/or tedious to set up for multiple pokemon. Anyway, let's proceed with the tutorial.
?
If you haven't guessed yet, this will require the ACE (arbitrary code execution) items (8F in R/B, ws m in Y), so if you don't want to risk deleting your save and/or don't want to spend 2+ hours setting up the glitch, then this guide is not for you.
This guide will assume that you've already obtained 8F or ws m, and have set up the bootstrap in the PC Box accordingly. If you haven't yet, there are plenty of tutorials out there on how to set the glitch up, like this and this.
?
Once you've set up the glitch, you will need the following items in your inventory in this exact order (The following is tested on Yellow. Haven't tried the code for R/B but it's probably fine):

Any item
ws m (8F for R/B)
Lemonade x170
X Accuracy x134 EDIT: (for R/B, have x178 instead)
Carbos x209 EDIT: (for R/B, have x218 instead)
Pokeball x119
Lemonade x170
X Accuracy x133 EDIT: (for R/B, have x177 instead)
Carbos x209 EDIT: (for R/B, have x218 instead)
Pokeball x119
Fresh Water x201

?
Yeah, I know it's a lot, but if you're planning on turning more than one pokemon shiny, it'll be worth the effort.
Now, place the pokemon you want to ""shinify"" as your party lead, then use the ACE item. to check if it worked, take note of your pokemon's current stats, then deposit it in the PC and check its stats again. It should change by a small amount.
EDIT: For Red and Blue, IMPORTANT additional info below
All you need to do now is place it in Box 1 of your PC, and transfer it over. You'll find that the pokemon you transferred is now shiny! How neat is that?
To make other pokemon shiny, just place them as your party lead and use the item again. So easy!
?
I have tested this multiple times on the Yellow VC, and it worked just fine.
BTW, if you know an easier method of achieving this, please tell me as I would like to know!
EDIT: I have made a huge oversight regarding how 8F works in Red and Blue. The code DOES STILL WORK, however, due to how the bootstrapping is done in R/B, one of the bootstrap pokemon (a.k.a. the party lead) will become shiny instead. Now, if this is what you want, then no problem. However, if you really want a quick way of turning pokemon shiny, I've adjusted the values accordingly. You'll notice that it's quite similar to the code mentioned in /u/TransgenderPride's post (first link in this post), and that's because it's exactly the same thing, except that it's reusable. What the code does is it modifies the DVs of the first pokemon in the active PC Box, which makes it shiny. I HAVE tested this code on Red using an emulator, and got the expected results. But since it was done on an emulator, I can't show proof that it will become shiny, so if anyone wants to try it on the VC and share their results, please do so. :) Thanks, and huge apologies for editing this late. I'll also post a guide on using ws m / 8F to modify the pokemon's nature upon transfer, so watch out for that soon :P Cheers!

But there are just a lot of things about them that bug me. If you were to tell me to rank the pokemon games, I'd put them 4th or 5th- but I'd still give them an 8/10. They're good dames, but nowhere near my favorites.
Also, for the sake of this analysis thing, ""gameplay"" refers to the pokemon league challenge and the level design, and ""story"" refers to the actual story- basically the fight against the evil team.
Gen 7 has been receiving a lot of praise, and it's not unwarranted. The battles are fun, the story is great, the new pokemon are cool, stuff like that. However, I really can't agree with the sentiment that these are some of the best pokemon games- they're really good, but there are some flaws that they have that keep me from liking them. Two in particular are what I think really hold this game back, though one is honestly opinion (heck. they're probably both opinion); the region of Alola, and the emphasis on story over gameplay.
First, Alola. I personally find Alola to be probably the weakest of all the regions. The first reason is the level design, which is not very good. Most routes seem to just be uninteresting blobs, and dungeons are non-existent. All but two dungeons are just one room with no puzzles; Po Town and Vast Poni Canyon. Of those, the later is both the best area of the game and the game's single greatest flaw- which I will explain later.
The second thing I don't like about Alola is how disconnected it is. The region consisting of 4 islands might sound good on paper, but in practice it really harms the mood for me. It doesn't really feel like I'm on this grand adventure through a large region; it feels more like I'm on vacation, which just doesn't work. The lack of towns is also baffling; it really feels like no one lives on Alola. I know Hawaii has a lot of nature reserves and such, but each island still has more cities then quite possibly the whole of Alola combined!
The second, and much bigger flaw, is how the gameplay is pushed to the side. No, I'm not talking about how the whole first island is just a tutorial, though that is frustrating. I'm talking about how the entire Alola challenge is completely pointless by the end of the game.
The game starts as a normal pokemon game, only with lots and lots of cutscenes- too many, if I'll be honest, but I'm not talking about those right now. However, at the end of the 3rd island, the whole plot suddenly shifts into gear.
And the island challenge is completely forgotten about, from a narrative perspective at least.
The problem with Lusamine's whole plan is that it neither concerns the player directly nor does it effect the island challenge. If Lillie literally did not exist, we would have no motivation to go to the Ultra Dimension. You, the main character, not only have nothing to do with it, but you're not effected by Lusamine's disappearance, save for Team Skull blocking the way to Vast Poni Canyon because they want their Guzma back.
In fact, Vast Poni Canyon is probably the reason why I think about Sun and Moon the way I do. Because after beating not only VPC, but the pokemon league itself, I realized something.
The game climaxes too early.
The climax of the game is not the pokemon league. That is the falling action. Instead, it is confronting Lusamine in the Ultra Dimension. On the way to doing so, you fight both Hapu and the last trial. In fact, the last trial doesn't really serve a purpose, other then letting the developers wrap up a plot line they clearly don't care about. The problem with this is that, after beating Lusamine and saving her, there is no tension- the game has, essentially, ended. They could roll the credits right after you catch Solgaleo/Lunala, and the plot wouldn't be effected.
But you still have the pokemon league. And that's the problem- from a narrative perspective, the game has ended. But you have to fight the elite four and the professor, with essentially no build up to get the tension back up mind you, because Mount Lanakila is a complete joke of a victory road.
If I were to make this game, I'd simply switch the location of the Lake and the Altar- instead of going to Poni Island, you head to Ula'Ula meadow, then you fight Lusamine and the box legend, then you go to Poni Island. That way, the tension is built back up for the elite four, and the island challenge isn't just abandoned in a ditch. If they had simply done that, I would probably rate this game much more highly.
Just as one last point, I do not object with story in a pokemon game. My favorite games in the series are, in fact, Pokemon Black and White. With those games, the emphasis is both on gameplay and story; rather then simply ignoring the formula for the pokemon games, they intertwine the formula with an actual plot. This, in my opinion, is much better then what Gen 7 did. Maybe I'll go more in depth later.
TL;DR- Alola is not that good of a region. The routes are boring, dungeons non-existent, and the region being divided into four chunks makes it less grand. The plot completely overrules the island challenge and makes it pointless. Furthermore, the game climaxes too soon. This could be fixed by making you go to Poni Island after saving Lusamine, allowing the tension to build back up and for the elite four to be a proper secondary climax.

The Woolly Crab Pokemon
It aimed for the top but got lost and ended up on a snowy mountain. Being forced to endure the cold, this Pokemon evolved and grew fur. It just throws punches indiscriminately. In times of desperation, it can lop off its own pincers and fire them like rockets.

The Boxing Pokemon
While guarding its weak points with its pincers, it looks for an opening and unleashes punches. When it loses, it foams at the mouth and faints. It punches so much, its pincers often come off from overuse, but they grow back quickly. What little meat they contain is rich and delicious.

I don't think Pokemon benefits from being cryptic like this, if that makes sense - it's not like I'm asking GF/TPCI to make the game engine open-source or something, right?

Normally, like FRLG, HGSS, and ORAS, the games will keep their original names with an added word.
I was thinking about what it would be for the next coming series when this possibility hit me.
Black Diamond & White Pearl
A game set in the Sinnoh region, that takes place between the events of BW & B2W2.
I'd like the idea of being able to travel to Unova but I'm not sure if GameFreak will ever empliment 2 regions in a single game again.

I'm aware there are already possessed item Ghost Pokemon but what if instead of an item, a Pokemon was possessed instead? 
Off the top of my head a 1/2 step evolution. 
Initially starts out a small, cream coloured bear quite jittery movements, occasionally turning around frantically as if something is there. Perhaps shivering with its hands clasped. It's eyes are always darting about. Similar to someone walking around a haunted house. Defined as a 'paranoid Pokemon'. Dex could read ""This timid Pokemon hides away as much as possible. It always feels like it is being watched, making it paranoid of its surroundings at all times"" 
The second form is still normal type defined as a 'ghost hunter' Pokemon. It could carry a big magnifying glass with its tail and have an almost Sherlock Holmes style hat.
The dex could read something like ""This Pokemon is incredibly sensitive to paranormal activity. Becoming brave, It relentlessly investigates day and night"" 
Then when it evolves again it would become a normal/ghost type (possessed Pokemon) The magnifying glass it holds in its tail would be looming behind it with the 'Mean Look' eye present in the lens (which would look around like an eye) its physical eyes could be whited out (similar to Parasect) and it could be floating slightly in a somewhat stiff manner.
The dex could read something like ""Its relentless investigations have found the source of its paranoia. This Pokemon got more than it bargained for..."" 
Off the top of my head it'd probably be something like Scare-d, Quriozi-d, Curse-d (idk something like that) 
Sort of going from scared to curious to possessed but I can't think of a good final one.
Anyway, if you read this far thanks for reading! Any thoughts? 
As I said it's still just a small idea for the moment. I'd live one on my team!

In other Pokemon games I went on a journey because I merely wanted to go on an adventure and eventually challenge the champion. With sun and Moon, I'm going on a journey because it's a tradition for new trainers and a diety wanted me to. On top of that, the new kahuna position cannot be refused. It sounds like everyone's reason for Pokemon battling is because one of the island dieties told them to. I have always loved Pokemon because of its great portrayal of competitive ideals. The idea of going on a journey to slowly but surely gain skill and eventually challenge the very best. That idea is thrown out the window if the whole reason I'm going on a journey is because of tradition or an undeniable request from the island diety. I'm wondering if this is actually a theme explored in the story of the game or if it is merely this game's way of getting you to go on a journey. Will this idea of""because the island diety said so"" be explored further? If there is one thing I love it's when Pokemon games have a special theme explored with the story. Gen 3 had the idea of radical positions of 1 side of an extreme are never ideal, and that all conflict in the world derives from disagreement of where the balance is, and gen 5 had the theme of ideals vs truth and how the truth may not always overlap with our ideals. It is up to us to decide whether the truth is ideal or not. There is no define answer. I'm wondering if the idea of choice vs enevitable obligations is the theme of sun and Moon. If it is not, what is the theme? Was I close? Is there a theme at all? Sorry if I came off as rude. I was just wondering what you guys had to say. If possible, please answer with minimal spoilers.

After a few deaths later I had no choice but to use my tank wishiwashi that flooded everything in its way. Gets OHKO with solar blade with power herb. My salandit barely stood a chance as well. Some how i eventually won that battle. Hau still kinda sucks as a rival but gladion buts him in his place. Type null actually proved quite a challange against my crabrawler. Ive never seen a tackle more powerful. Right now im going to the electric trail so im not THAT far into the game.

Giovanni had a Honchkrow in a Celebi event in HeartGold/SoulSilver (in Gen 1, Dark types didn't exist either).
Archer had a Houndoom
Both Maxie and Archie have a Mightyena, while Archie also has a Sharpedo.
Cyrus has a Weavile, Honchkrow, and (in Platinum) a Houndoom.
N (during his tenure as a Villain Team Leader) has a Zoroark. Ghetsis himself has Hydreigon, a Bisharp in Black/White, and a Drapion in Black/White 2.
Lysandre has a Honchkrow and Mega Gyarados.
And how about our boy Guzma? He has a team filled with Bug type Pokemon ... none of them being Dark types. Pretty interesting that Gen 7 broke that particular trend of ""the villain team leader always carrying a Dark type"". I could let Giovanni slide due to the fact Dark types didn't exist in Gen 1, but he himself has a Honchkrow in an Event exclusive battle.
Even moreso, Lusamine doesn't have any Dark types in her team either. Surprisingly for a villain team leader, she carries a Fairy type though ... and a Milotic.

Calling for help.
It is brutal. I nearly got wiped out by Wishiwashi and Lurantis during the water and grass trials because they called Pokemon that were incredibly advantageous to them. Wishiwashi called out Alomomola which kept using Heal Pulse, and Lurantis called out Castform, which kept using Sunny Day and Lurantis proceeded to Solar Blade the crap out of my team.
I've had the EXP Share on for all this, by the way, so I don't think I was underleveled.
Okay, if it was just the Totem Pokemon, it wouldn't be so bad.
But even wild Pokemon can call for help. It's like Earthbound all over again, in which Pokemon can just infinitely call for help and more keep showing up. It makes it incredibly difficult to capture Pokemon.
I swear, I've never had an actual complaint about a Pokemon game's mechanics until now.
Don't get me wrong, I still love the game. It's just that the whole ""calling for help"" thing with wild Pokemon gets REALLY annoying and really tedious when I'm trying to complete my Pokedex.
Has anyone else had this issue? I hope I'm not the only one...

I wanted to make a pokemon anime, and I realized that I needed a lot of things.  I realized that I needed to have sound (voices, music).  Luckily, I know a lot of people who can help me with this.  I also knew that I wold need to be able to write and animate.  However, I needed to learn to draw to be able to animate.  This is the first full image I have ever drawn that I am very proud of http://i.imgur.com/OcCg6qR.png.  Should I give credit to artists that I used as references?  It is a bit weird for a few reasons.  1. I know you don't ever have to credit fan artists, but it is good to.  2. You cannot know what a pokemon looks like without art.
three years ago, my art was very, very bad.  I still struggle a lot, but my improvement is huge!  Some of the first drawings I did after the beginning of my journey toward improvement were here for reddit draws pokemon.
Anyway, I have finally learned how to draw well enough to start, I think.  However, I am looking for critiques on my drawing.  Thanks!
P.S. I don't expect the anime to be finished in the next three years.

11369	"What's the Appeal of Discussing Who's the Strongest in the Anime?"	"1"	"7"	"20170327"	"TheRThor"	"Discussions on determining the strongest trainer in the games is a lot easier because the NPCs have a fixed team(s) to work with. We could even go far as to analyze the code and figure out the quantitative information of the pokemon as well. I.e. there's a clear set of rules and data at our disposal for discussion.
But the anime has proven itself to be inconsistent in many ways. Including power levels. Basically, unlike the games, there's no clear set of rules or data for us to work with. That said, I definitely understand the fun in paying attention to the details and constructing a hypothesis/simulation with said details. 
What I don't quite understand is how anyone could come to a conclusion and be certain that their guess is accurate. I'm not sure how many on /r/pokemon think that way, but I just want to read your thoughts on the topic.
tldr: How do some people believe that a certain character in the anime is the strongest with certainty? When there's no clear standard to work with?

11406	"What starters would you like to see in the next game"	"13"	"65"	"20170320"	"AW038619Z-Splash you to death!"	"What starters would you like to see in the next game? I thought of the concept for a batch of starters (I know Gen 7 is still pretty recent), so I thought I would share it...
Here are the concepts (all final evo forms):
Grass starter: a grass/rock type giant that looks like the robots from Laputa (Castle in the Sky) mixed with Regigigas. It will be a slow, bulky physical wall and for hidden ability I am thinking a variant of shield dust.
Fire starter: a fire/electric type stag with flaming legs (like blaziken's arms) and huge antlers shaped like multiple lightning bolts. It will be a fast physical attacker and for hidden ability levitate would be awesome (maybe it can fly like a reindeer lol).
Water starter: water/fighting type sea anemone/octopus. I know this one sounds a bit weird but I imagine it as a humanoid pokemon with huge fists (fighting type), a sea anemone head (with the tentacles as hair) and an octopus-like lower body (somewhat like Omastar's lower body, except much more tentacles). It will be a bulky physical attacker with hidden ability such as sheer force.
My idea is that each starter has a secondary typing that gives it an advantage when fighting the starter that's normally super effective against it (grass has rock that beats fire, fire has electric that beats water, and water has fighting that beats the grass/rock). This is somewhat like a secondary type triangle except not exactly.
P.S.: i really wanted to draw these ones too, but my drawing skills are terrible...

It was the one that started my fixation on Pokemon. I remember asking my younger brother everyday about the aired episodes since he didn't have class in the morning at that time. It was an OK dub but the later seasons were shortened due to broadcast issues.
Weird facts about our dub:
-XY aired first before BW. I myself was surprised when I first heard about it. I think they realized their mistake since after a number of episodes, BW was then aired.
-The dub was based on the English version with the exception of DP (and probably BW and XY but I didn't check) where they used the Japanese one. What's impressive though that they still used English names of characters and Pokemon so I commend their effort for that.
-Due to this, Pokemon's voices were dubbed over by the local dub actors with the exception of probably Pikachu.

Now when it comes to Mythical Pokemon, they just give us the Pokemon directly, which in my opinion seems to take out a lot of the fun of Mythical Pokemon because there's this special something about exploring an unexplored location to track it down, which could expose some more lore about the Pokemon. Does anyone miss the old way where they gave us an item and we had to catch the Pokemon?

11440	"Pokemon Sun and Moon Anime Opinion"	"7"	"16"	"20170410"	"crimsoneagle1"	"I recently just started watching the sun and moon anime today (got to about episode 10). And so far the series is definitely different than the other seasons I've watched. As a kid I watched the first season all the way till the end of Hoenn. Then I stopped watching for whatever reason. I recently saw X and Y on Netflix I started watching those. So pretty much I missed the stuff from the Sinnoh region and the Unova. 
They seem to be taking a much more lighthearted approach to this season compared to X and Y, kind of reminds me of the very first season of Pokemon except Ash actually knows what he is doing this time (for the most part). I like the colors, it's almost similar to some of the episodes in the Orange Islands Arc, where it's tropical and very colorful. 
The character art is interesting as well, it doesn't look as clean as X and Y. It's actually almost a throwback to some anime from the 90s. And in some characters I get the vibe that they were designed to look like they belong in the first season of Pokemon. I actually like the character art though, I didn't at first but I think around episode 3 it grew on me. Also Ash and Pikachu's facial expressions really sell me on it. It seems like they are so much more expressive this season than before. Even though some of it is silly, I kind of dig it. 
Now the actual story at this point seems fairly slow. It doesn't seem like Ash has any real goals to go off of. I mean, there is the overarcing goal of him wanting to be a Pokemon master, but that's it. I guess the goal for this season is to master z-moves? Also his life seems to be fairly repetitive at this point: go to school, try to catch a new pokemon, maybe do an island challenge. I'd like to see him leave the trainer school behind and actually explore the islands. Ash has always learned by getting experience, so seeing him in school is kind of a drag. Although, at the same time, it is refreshing to see the show take on a completely different pace than before. (NOTE: I'm still only on episode 10, so all of this may have become irrelevant by now)
The season isn't bad by any means, it could still get better though and I'm sure it will in time. But it really feels like they are trying to hammer home a nostalgic factor and making it feel like a 90s anime. 20th anniversary and all that I guess. The show, at this point, feels like a soft reboot to the series. Although, thankfully they didn't completely dumb down Ash and they also didn't completely nerf Pikachu's power (for the most part). Although seeing Pikachu get beat by a Grubbin was painful to watch. 
Anyway, this is all my opinion. It could be the worst opinion ever, I don't really care. Feel free to discuss or bring up things that happen in future or past episodes. I don't really believe in spoilers so everything is fair game.

11441	"The ultimate team to catch them all."	"12"	"4"	"20170410"	"Mokgore"	"With Pokemon Bank, it is now possible to achieve, afaik, a complete Pokedex in Sun and Moon. This requires X, Y, OR, AS, Sun, and Moon. 
Playing through each story twice can be tedious for the sake of only a few Pokemon. Having already completed one game from each pair, I want to complete my dex as painlessly as possible. As such, I want to design a team for X and Y which I can use to easily walk through the elite four and catch every Pokemon on the way there. And I want to transfer this same team from XY to ORAS to SM. 
At the head of this team is:
Smeargle, the Jolly Technician. With 252 Attack and Speed, False Swipe, Taunt, Soak, and Spore, there are only a handful of Pokemon against whom Smeargle struggles... to weaken. We won't get into trying to battle with it. That's what the rest of the team is for.
I have considered backing Smergle with Amoongus setup with Gastro Acid, Spore and Stun Spore, or Gallade with the obvious, for those tricky Pokemon where Smeargle just doesn't perform. 
But, what about the other four Pokemon? And this is where I need your help, trainer. The rest of this team cannot simply be the strongest ubers of all the lands, for in the days of old, men spoke in hushed voices of horrors not of this Earth. To gaze upon them was for the very fabric of the universe to unwind. They could not be understood. Lovecraft himself would turn in his coffin at the mere mention of their names. Yes, these men spoke true. These men spoke, of Hidden Machines.

The grass type is bad offensively and defensively. Five weaknesses and seven resistors, and I can't find myself using Grass-type Pokemon or moves aside from specialized Super Effectives. The advantage against Water is negated by the fact that Water types can shut them down with Ice type moves, and the advantage against Ground isn't much either considering how many of them have movesets that can use moves like Aerial Ace.
Maybe I'm missing something here. Is there a way to use Grass-type Pokemon right? I don't know.

I am no programmer, but there must be a way to integrate the 3DS console clock for GSC on VC. Originally, the clock ran on the cartridge battery. I foresee two potential complications with a GSC rerelease:
1) The player manually sets the time at the start of a new game. Would the 3DS override this prompt and automatically populate it with the time according to system preferences? How might they work around two potentially conflicting clocks?
2) Daylight Savings. By talking to her in-game, the player's mom could adjust the time by one hour if DLS were in effect. However, if the player talked to her around midnight, she would say to come back later. This was intentionally programmed so that the player could not ""travel back in time"" to the previous day. I suppose a VC rerelease could simply remove this function from the game, since any clock changes would be made in system preferences. This was probably only in the US version anyway. 
I know that clock manipulation has been common since Gen 4, so this is not a new problem. If Nintendo could integrate wireless trading for the RBY rerelease, them I'm sure they could update clock functionality for GSC. 
Thoughts?

If the next game is on the 3DS maybe they would have a way to access your old save file so you can fight your actual old lineup, but if the next game is on the Switch that would present a bigger logistical problem.  Lets just say the developers can't do that, and have to just pick one lineup.
What lineup do you think would be best?  Red's lineup was pretty simple to work out.  If we're assuming a play through more like Yellow version then it makes sense that Red would be using Pikachu, Charizard,  Blastoise, and Venusaur, and only the final two are really debatable.  With Sun/Moon it might make less sense for them to have all the starters although they still maybe could.

"Alright, last night I was watching Destiny Deoxys (which was fine) when a thought occurred to to me last night. But before we get to that, one other detail I am ramming in here. Game Freak has seemingly toned down the mythical pokemon, after the abundance we got in Gens 4 and 5. I mean it went from 1 -> 1 -> 2 -> 4 -> 4 -> 3 -> 2.
Anyway. I noticed Game freak really likes Deoxys. He shows up quite a bit. (Note this does not count appearing in the 'world of pokemon' things at the beginning of movies) As well as the aforementioned movie, he:
- showed up in one of the pikachu specials, PK21
- episode 112 of the diamond and pearl anime
- a pokemon ranger Special AG171
- and is the ONLY mythical to show up in pokemon generations
Now, You might be like, What's the matter? Special Pokemon show up all the time. Well, other mythical pokemon that show up very often are Mew and Celebi (Duh), and Manaphy (For some reason). This does exclude the Kalosian and Alolan mythicals, which have only been around for 3 years max.
Still, you're probably like And...?  Well, Deoxys also has another distinction. It is so far (get to that later) the only mythical pokemon to be available in a game without the need of an event or side game, being catch-able in ORAS' Delta Episode. He also was excluded from the 2016 mythical celebration, likely due to ORAS (The kalosian and Alolan mythical were too, but refer to the upper paragraph.)
Now, I want to get to the actual discussion, so my half hour of work doesn't get removed. I think that game freak may be attempting to move some mythicals to be catch-able without events. Again, what real reason did they have to make Deoxys catch-able, other than reference Destiny Deoxys (The way the triangle moves in DE is very similar to a little animation that plays on the dvd menu of destiny deoxys). Anyway, I think they may do the same if they remake Diamond and Pearl.
Let me know if I missed anything (I ignored Meloetta in the anime because I have never seen the BW anime before), any thing is incorrect, or if you have anything interesting to add. I'll credit you an' all so in an edit.
Tldr: I think GF may try to make more mythicals obtainable without events.
Edit 1: One user, ZeraX7, wanted me to check if GF had a hand in the anime. At least Sugemori and Masuda did, including in Destiny Deoxys.

In fact, the Dark-type Z-Move is called Black Hole Eclipse, which involves creating a black hole to suck in the opponent before exploding.

It really pains me that there will NEVER be another game like this. Since it's their 20th anniversary, this game is probably special. 
The biggest thing that improved was difficulty. Yes they made it easier with full heals from Lillie, Hau and others, but they managed to make the trials actually fun and you need to have some strategy and trainers have a decent AI... The story was really good too. Feeling myself immersed as if I am actually playing. The references and little jokes made every little enjoyment. Especially the scene which your starter chooses you and accepts you.. that was well made.
Thank you Game Freak.
This is just my opinion. I do not care if you think it sucks.

The ones that are bad are still alright, while the good ones are (imo) amazing. The beastliness of the designs and general tone of the designs fit with the sleek and almost futuristic style that the games went for. I know a lot of people hate Gen V, and especially the designs, but I really don't. Definitely anticipating some negative feedback to Gen V's designs here.
That being said, my least favorite is probably Ferroseed. I like Ferrothorn a lot, but Ferroseed's a little dull. It's just a spiky oval with eyes. Patrat and the elemental monkeys are also not great, but I can still sorta appreciate their designs. Ferroseed's just pretty meh. Cool typing and ability, though.
Oh, and if it was least favourite name, Ducklett might be the worst name since Seel.

11538	"Some Thoughts On the Trials In the Possible Third Gen. 7 Game"	"3"	"38"	"20170409"	"dylpro97#justice4wigglytuff"	"So, I was thinking about how there were a lot of characters who seemed more significant than they ended up being, such as Mina, Ryuki and Kahili. If there indeed is a Pokemon Star/Eclipse/etc., I think there would be a way to include them. 
Since there was no Dragon trial captain - and Ryuki is a Dragon Tamer - he's the obvious Poni Island captain. So there's one.
Acerola is now a member of the E4, so assuming she remains there, her spot as one of the Ula'Ula captains will be up for grabs. That spot would go to Kahili, who would have her trial on the golf course. There's two. 
Finally, I would hope that by the time that the third game was taking place, Mina would have set up her trial, which would most likely be in Poni Meadow. 
Therefore, we would have 8 Trials, which is the traditional number of gyms every other game has had. I know that with Kahili having a trial, this would leave an open spot in the Elite 4. I think that spot could be filled by either Guzma, Molayne, Faba, Wicke, Plumeria, or even Lillie. However, I think that it would most likely be Guzma. 
The Trial order would be:
1. Ilima in Verdant Cavern
2. Lana in Brooklet Hill
3. Kiawe in Wela Volcano Park
4. Mallow in Lush Jungle
5. Kahili in the Hano Grand Resort
6. Sophocles in Hokulani Observatory
7. Ryuki in Vast Poni Canyon
8. Mina in Poni Meadow
Elite Four:
1. Hala
2. Guzma (or any of the others)
3. Acerola
4. Olivia
Champion:
Hau, Lillie or Kukui.
I've made a post previously about what I think Mina's trial would be like. However, I'd be interested to see what you think of this idea and, furthermore, what Kahili and Ryuki's trials would be like.

/r/Pokemon Challenge for the week of April 9, 2017: Beat the game as an NPC!
Challenge: Use the team of any non-player character in the franchise to defeat the Elite Four and Champion in a main series Pokemon game. If you are playing in a game that features character customization, change your outfit to reflect the NPC's as closely as possible.
Details:

You may use the team of any NPC from any installment or stage in the franchise, including side games or the Pokemon anime.
Feel free to raise your own team members to higher levels than the NPC's, and to teach them different moves (or not) as you choose!
If your character has multiple battling teams at different points, you can use the team from whichever stage of the story you like.
Try to preserve the NPC's team as closely as possible in terms of evolutionary stage, gender etc, but feel free to make changes if it makes things more fun!


To confirm you completed the challenge and claim your reward, include the word ""complete"" in a comment below. Also tell us how you did it and why: Which trainer did you pick, and how did you raise the team? Why did you pick that character? Which game's E4 did you defeat? What was the most difficult part?

ADDITIONAL NOTE: I AM PRIMARILY REFERRING TO THE COMPETITIVE SIDE OF THE GAME! Sorry I didn't make this clear earlier.
Oh man, this is something often talked about once in a while, but let's do it again! I mostly want to see where everyone stands in this, what I believe to be, controversial topic. I'll be also giving a potential replacement for this luck-based part of the game.
Let me start by saying that luck is a completely okay factor. Moves that have a secondary effect, moves with lower accuracy, or even moves with a chance to crit are fine because that is part of the move's appeal and that is taken into consideration when building a team.
As it stands now, EVERY attack move has a 6.25% chance to land a critical hit, without any special abilities, without any held items, or without using a move that boosts the chance of landing one. Yes, I have heard people saying that it is a necessary evil because it balances out teams that set up walls and defenses, but the thing is that we do have moves to take care of that. Mist, Clear Smog, Haze, Roar, Dragon Tail, Whirlwind, Brick Break, just to name a few.
What crits essentially do is add luck to every single move you make in battles and it just sometimes tosses strategy right out of the window just because you or your opponent got unlucky.
My proposal, which keeps crits as part of the game, is:

Critical-Hit Ratio should start at 0%. Meaning, remove stage 0 altogether [1/6 (6.25%)]
Alter moves with a high critical-hit ratio to start at stage 2, not 1. (Just like it was in gen II-III)
Revert back to the old critical hit ratio stages from Gen II-V, but without stage 0.

Starting from Gen VI, critical hits have become more common and, just more annoying altogether. Anyways, to me, critical hits are not fun. Call this a little bit of a rant if you will, but I just wanted to share my thoughts about this and see what other people thought about this mechanic as it is today. Maybe you guys have a better idea on how to go about this?
Share your thoughts.
edit 1: formatting and grammar. :p
edit 2: further clarified proposed alternative.
edit 3: I was mostly talking about the competitive side of the game, have no idea why I forgot to make a note of that earlier.

11557	"Pokemon: My story"	"38"	"8"	"20170409"	"barbarasasakiThe Girl That Comes From Shadows"	"Hello! You may find this post a bit boring, but I guess that is time for me to share my story with you about the franchise and how it changed my life. I¡¦ll try not to do an extremely long post, but there will be some parts that I will describe with a lot of words
I remember that, when I was 5 years old, a cousin¡¦s dad gave him a Game Boy (Color, I guess) with Pokemon Green. We played it, not knowing any Japanese, and also fought when singing the first opening song.
Fast forward 8 years, and my godfathers gave me my first computer, and I re-discovered the game. I first played the Hoenn GBA games, but, when Brendan kept defeating my Combusken, I discovered gamesharks. I enjoyed the game with them, since they made my playthroughs very easier in the different games. I played Diamond and Pearl so much, that when Platinum came out in Japanese, I had no problem remembering the attacks. I remember one time at school, when I was playing Platinum, and had caught Giratina, lights went out, and almost screamed a bad word haha.
After 5 years, I got my first 3DS, and played a lot of games with an R4, until I made a bet with my dad, and he gave me Pokemon White 2, my first original game. Some years after that, I discovered the competitive game, when I challenged a University classmate to a battle. He sweeped me with just one Pokemon, and I promised that I was going to defeat him one day.
When X&Y came out, I already owned Platinum (my mom let me get one game. I wanted Diamond, but when I found P, I said ¡§I WANT THIS¡¨) and was short of money. My mom gave me the rest of it, and bought my first 3DS game the day it came out. After that, I got Pearl (as a gift for myself hahaha) & White (I went to the most northern part of Chile, and freaked out when I found the game), but something terrible happened some months later.
Somehow, I got my 3DS stolen with all my games in it. I was shattered, cried like never before (I lost my first legal shiny). And in that moment I found friends that, even after stopped speaking to some of them time after that, were there for me. One GAVE ME AS A GIFT a 3DS XL, some gave me the basics to breed again (Dittos & stuff) and one gave me two Ralts: one none and one shiny that I still keep in my X game. 
I started to participate and learn about the competitive game¡Kand also¡Kfound love. I learned a lot by myself, but a guy, which name I won¡¦t tell, taught me lots of things about VGC. One day he gave me a Kangaskhan for Trick Room, after telling me that I fought ¡§like a champion¡¨ (He also gave me a Milotic).  I fell in love with him without noticing it. Skip to ORAS, and because of a reason that I won¡¦t tell, because I still respect him, our trust and friendship was broken. In that time I met other friends with different backstories, and started to recover confidence in myself.
Fast forward to last year with VGC16, I started to develop my own way to learn about the franchise. I read a lot by myself when I couldn¡¦t sleep, started to watch some players and also, made more friends that I still keep until today. I also developed some knowledge about TCG, so, I know a bit of almost everything about Pokemon.
In my city there were almost no girls that played the game, so, there was a time when I, as far as I knew, was the only one that played the game with enthusiasm. I started to have more friends, and also started to obsess with the game, but I stopped a bit after almost failing some subjects of my University. 
(Sort of a tl;dr) I won¡¦t write a lot more, but Pokemon and the friends that I make through time are one of the most important things that I treasure now, being 24 years old. They are there when I¡¦m feeling down; they are there when no one else is. I re-bought the games that I lost and got more (and also a GBA SP and DS Lite with almost pure Pokemon games). People know me because of it, and also respect me because of my passion. I¡¦m not the best female VGC player, but I know I¡¦m not the worst. My mom sometimes says that I should stop being a fan, but she¡¦s the first that buys me stuff. My dad also helps me with money when I want something not so expensive.
To make things short: Pokemon is one of the most important parts of my life, and I won¡¦t stop playing it soon. Thanks for reading this; I wanted to express some of my inner feelings about it.

They are asexual reproduce and sexual reproduction. Budding is a type of asexual reproduction, where the new organism forms on the parent and then detaches. This could explain many strange issues about the Pokemon world:

The endless seeming wild Pokemon in the games could be due to budding, as it is much quicker,safer, and has a higher yield than sexual reproduction.
How legendaries are genderless.
How Pokemon with a 100% chance of a certain gender appear.

Of course, a lot of animals can reproduce both sexually and asexually, so it makes sense for Pokemon to as well(see the Day Care). However, legendaries can only reproduce by budding, and can't breed.
Please criticize my theory, and thanks for reading.

11563	"If GameFreak were to put Paul in the Gen 4 remakes, here is how I would like his character to be portrayed."	"13"	"24"	"20170320"	"XeroRW"	"Paul. Fans of the D&P saga like myself loved to hate him. In the beginning, he was cocky, rude, and arrogant. As the series went on, I found him to be a bit more humble, yet still keeping in touch with his rude and arrogant side. Toward the end of the saga, he was shown to have been changed, in a subtle way, which was done very well. This is kinda how I'd like Paul to be in the games, if he were to be in them.
Some requirements for a good in-game Paul:
-Mega-Electivire (this will be explained later)
-A later introduction (introduce him after the 1st Gym) 
-Have the game script arranged loses for the main character, so that Paul can live up to the overwhelming rival. These loses will happen through the player's attacks missing/failing & certain attacks from Paul hitting easy crits 
-He has a rotating team. This means that he won't be limited to just six Pokemon. What Pokemon he uses and when will be a random generation based on the player's trainer's ID. This rule won't apply for Elekid/Electabuzz/Electivire, who will always be in Paul's party. But the rule goes that he must use the ones that he uses in the show.
-His Pokemon will be the same as they are in the show, with the added addition of maybe a Unova, Kalos, or Alola Pokemon.
A (sorta) brief story summary of Paul
-the player first meets Paul after his/her first gym battle. No matter what, Paul gives a subtle insult to how the player did in battle. Paul then challenges the trainer to a three on three Battle. If the player doesn't have three Pokemon, Paul will insult the player and leave. If the player does have three+ Pokemon, the player will select which three are used. No matter what, the player will lose this battle. Paul proceeds to the next town. 
-Paul is next seen after the next gym, where he is seen training Elekid and Urasaring (due to leveling, this Pokemon won't be in the actual battle rotation until later in the game). Paul criticizes the player's training style, saying that being too friendly will soften Pokemon up to much. He then walks off.
-If the remakes follow the gym leader order of D/P, when the player reaches the end of Fantina's maize, there will be a cutscene of Paul defeating Fantina. He acts respectfully, showing that he is respectful to his elders, like in the show. If the gym leader order is the platinum order, this scene either simply won't exist, or will be reserved to a later scene. 
-The player next encounters Paul in Veilstone City, where they meet Reggie, his older brother. Interesting thing about Reggie: he will be able to teach ONE Pokemon ONE move that the Pokemon doesn't regularly learn until a higher level (this is inspired by Reggie helping Ash teach Staravia Brave Bird in the show) if the Pokemon's friendship is high enough. Reggie compared the two trainers (Paul and the player) to eachother and gives some speech about friendship and whatever. Paul doesn't seem to want to listen. He bids his brother goodbye and heads to the next town. Reggie comments about Paul's character.
-Paul will challenge the player to a three on three Battle before the trainer gets to Pastoria City. This will be another scripted loss (sorry guys)
-After the player gets five gym badges and goes to the route linking Jubilife and the Iron type Gym city (sorry, I forgot the name). This time, when you Battle him, you can win. It will be a three in three Battle. Instead of congratulating the player, Paul will downplay the trainer's victory and walk off.
-The player will encounter Paul in Snowpoint City. Nothing major happens, just more insults.
-When the player goes back to Veilstone city to take down Team Galactic, Paul will assist, under Reggie's request. He will not encounter Cyrus alongside the player, for that is a Cyrus and player moment. After this, Paul is nowhere to be seen.
-For the final time before the player meeting Paul at the end of victory road, the player will encounter Paul when the player first enters Sunnyshore City. He will challenge you to a six on six Battle. Regardless if you have six Pokemon on your team or not, you will battle Paul. This is another scripted loss. Afterwards, Flint from the elite four introduces himself to you and Paul, saying that it was a good battle. At first, Paul doesn't respond (""...""), but later says it was an honor to meet Flint, thanks him, and leaves. 
-The player finally meets Paul at the end of victory road.... but there is no battle. Paul says he needs to continue training, and tells the player to go on, saying it won't matter because the player won't get very far. The Battle before the elite four is still given to Barry.
-After the Elite Four and Cynthia, the player goes to the Battle Frontier. Paul is finally encountered here. He says he has been searching for the player after he learned that the player beat the Pokemon League. He is standing by electivire, who is outside of it's Pokeball as a subtle reminder that he had grown with some of his Pokemon, or just specifically Elective. Electivire is sent out last. When it is sent out, Paul says that they've been in situations like this before, and encourages it to not give up now. After this, we get to see Paul Mega-Evolve Electivire. After the battle, Paul congrats the player and leaves. Paul can later be challenged weakly at Mnt. Stark after the Heatran mission is completed.
What are your thoughts on this route? Is it cheesy? Is it well thought out? How would you like to see Paul in the games?

They of course changed a lot of things and greatly improved upon them, but I feel they went a little overboard with the whole changing the standard Pokemon game layout. Change can be great, and was really needed in the series, but some things didn't need changed. And of those things, I'm curious to know which ones you guys miss most?

You've got Golurk and the Regi Trio that represent golems of Hebrew lore, not to mention how the weather trio mirrors the Hebrew story of the Leviathan, Behemoth, and Ziz. Not to mention you could make Hoopa available in-game, ala Deoxys in OR/AS, since it's meant to be a Djinn/genie. Oh, and then there's also Cofagrigus. 
But if I had to make up some Pokemon, then there could be one based on the more unusual stuff from the bible/torah/quran, and even include some of the apocryphal stuff, or the Kabbalah. Like there could be a Pokemon that's really similar to Kyogre in that it's a really big fish, but in reality, it takes the role of Bahamut from Islamic lore (before DnD took the name to refer to a dragon king of all things, then spreading into Final Fantasy as a result). Or there could be a Psychic/Fairy angel, but based on the more abstract, surreal designs, like the Ophanim. And then the Tree of Sephiroth (the FFVII villain's namesake!) could be the basis for a room's design, that houses the post-game legendary (ala Zygarde, Rayquaza, Giratina, etc.)...
There's no real need to bring in real-world politics, either. We didn't really see it in any of the other regions. For example, it's not like Saffron City had a Pokemon equivalent to the WWII Doolitte Raids, nor does Unova make explicit allegories to 9/11 (the WTC was in downtown, not midtown where the Unova desert would equate to, and Kyruem's height in the original metric isn't 911cm or something like that).

i just want some fixes for abilities to minimize the randomness such as

spore effect

make this ability to turn into 3 separated abilities, stun spore, sleep spore and poison spore, everyone having it usual chance to affect the opponent but also it affect ALWAYS if the target gets defeated by contact attack
the same with flame body, cursed body, static
also maybe give elemental boost like 10% more damage for those types
to make those abilities somekind useful, less random

stall raise critical chance

just that, if you attempt to heal too much or boost too much the opponent gets higher chance to land a critical, some way to defeat the stall viability a little or give a chance when the opponent get a +6 even maybe have somekind of critical speed/priority, if there is a possibility of sweep by the opponent you could gain a critical speed boost or move priority in someway to grasping at straws

11587	"My Spoiler-Free Pokemon Sun and Moon Review/ Thoughts"	"43"	"8"	"20161121"	"pjaywhyGet in the bag, Nebby"	"I don't wanna sound like someone who thinks their opinion is important, but I just finished the main story and figured that I would share my thoughts and opinions on the game. Again, no spoilers so don't worry! Feel free to share your thoughts too. I'm very interested to hear other opinions. This will be pretty long, so I'll probably throw a TLDR at the bottom.
So right off the start, I'm gonna say a negative about the game. The entire first island feels like one big tutorial. I know that this is for the younger or less experienced audience, but it felt way too long. Once people replay the game, the first island is gonna drag. That being said, the atmosphere of the game felt very up beat and cheery.
Team skull is easily one of my favorite teams ever introduced. They are freaking hilarious, and I Ioved reading their dialogue.
Once I got to the second island, the game was a lot less of a tutorial. I went around and got a lot of Pokemon, and the challenges were different, but in a good way. They felt a lot like classic rpg quests, and it was a great change of pace from literally every other Pokemon game. There wasn't a crap ton of story in this island, and it didn't really feel like there needed to be. It was more of a kinda just go around and do whatever island. 
The third island is where the story picked up, and boy did it pick up. I think insanely impressed on how dark the story got, and it was almost like watching an anime. The story is absolutely wild, and I loved it. Other than the story, the island itself was cool. You meet a few new characters, catch some Pokemon, do some trials, and dive into story. 
The fourth island continues the story, and you meet some more cool people. The fourth island is probably the best looking, imo. The story obviously is starting to close, since this is the last island, and the ending of the story is incredible. Once the story ends, you have one more challenge left. Once you finish that challenge, the main game is essentially over. I won't say much about the challenge, but I'm sure most of you can guess what it is. I will say the the final battle you have in the main story has the greatest boss battle music I think I have ever heard. It is so good. 
I haven't gotten much into post game, but I'm not expecting anything as great as the main story. I'm looking forward to playing it though. 
Overall I thought this was a great game. I don't think there has been a story that even comes close to this one. This is the best, most in depth, plot twists, and pretty dark. This is the first Pokemon game in a while that I can't wait to replay. A lot of people complain about a lot of dialogue, and there is a LOT, but if you think of it as a bit of a movie, it isn't too bad. 
TLDR: After island one, which was slow as hell the game is amazing. Challenges were different, and weren't repetitive. The story was freakin wild. 9/10

11595	"[SPOILERS] This is the first Pokemon game with a story, and it's amazing. (Story spoilers)"	"328"	"117"	"20161121"	"dumbelts"	"I have played just about every single Pokemon game, most more than once, including the spinoffs, and none have reached this level of development.
Part of the reason I feel that Gen 5 is the best generation of Pokemon games was because it was serious. It had a story that had a meaning. It had characters that were memorable (and also my favorite Pokemon but that's another discussion). It somewhat challenged the standard ""Gym -> Enemy Team is bad -> Capture Legendary -> Champion"". The Delta Episode of ORAS proved they could do some emotional development with Zinnia, but neither have reached the level Sun/Moon have.
This is best seen with the character Lillie. You literally watch her transform EVERY step of the way. She goes from being dressed in her mother's image and being timid and scared of the world, to being a fully fleshed, independent, developed human, who even sets off on her own journey (I desperately need a sequel game where she comes back and you battle her!). It was the first time I was ever emotionally invested in a Pokemon character.
That's not to mention that characters like Hau, Gladion, and Lusamine didn't surprise me. Guzma and Nanu get honorable mentions too! (I also still think they're related. Maybe the Sequel/Stars will elaborate on their relationship more). Everything about their characters felt so unique and fresh. Even the professor, who still fit the Pokemon archetype of the Professor character, felt like a brand new experience. 
I seriously cannot believe how amazing this game turned out. It was an absolute MASTERPIECE in terms of the story. There was some weird pacing, and I feel like there was a lot left unanswered/a lot more that could be elaborated on.
I am so impressed with the quality of this game. I cannot wait to see what the future of Pokemon games is from here-on out.

But which one of the birds do you think is the strongest?
I'll go ahead and start with my opinion: 
Swellow > Talonflame > Staraptor > Noctowl > Unfezant > Pidgeot
Along with Sceptile, Swellow was the backbone of Ash's Hoenn team, performing very well in the league and gym battles. In fact, after evolving, Swellow never fainted without taking at least one Pokemon down with it (the only expection to this rule is losing to Tobias' Latios). Swellow is one durable bird.
Talonflame has been shown to be quite a battler, even keeping up with Moltres and Zapdos. Talonflame was a reliable fighter in almost all of the Kalos Gym Battles and also did decently in the League. The flaming bird also benefited greatly from the improved animation quality of the XY series.
Staraptor sure has an impressive moveset and many victories under it's belt, but in my opinion it might be slightly overrated. Staraptor did well against Maylene and later beat Paul's Honchkrow and Weavile, but in the league battle against Paul it sadly did not achieve much.
Noctowl wasn't used a lot, but it's psychic powers were a huge help against Morty's ghosts. Later it easily lost against Harrison's Steelix, but in the Sinnoh league Noctowl was able to beat Conway's Lickilicky.
Kind of like Noctowl, Unfezant's performance was quite mediocre after it starred in a gym battle (Skyla). It lost against two unevolved Pokemon: Koffing and Riolu.
I hate to say it, but Pidgeot is the last one on my list. It really wasn't given many chances to shine - right from the start it suffered from the Worf Effect, losing to Ekans and Koffing just to give Caterpie the spotlight.

It seems logical that they should release one as they have an online breadboard and run their own competitive scene, so why hasn't there been one? So I thought that, if there was a balance update, what would be balanced?  So I spent Last night comping up with some (and by some I mean A LOT) ideas that could balance out the meta game for the better (or possibly for the worse).
Oh, and if you were wondering why there are the Japanese names for the attacks and abilities and the Pokedex numbers for each of the Pokemon, I was planning to Tweet-Extend this to Junichi Masuda and Shigeru Ohmori (the director of sun and moon) afterwards.

They were technically confirmed to happen eventually as soon as ORAS was announced, since GameFreak wouldn't just stop doing remakes after already doing them three times.
They would make a lot of money. I'm far from the only nostalgic Sinnoh fan.
If Pokemon does make the switch to the Nintendo Switch starting with the next installment, it would continue the trend of remakes coming on a platform the original couldn't be played on.
Sinnoh starters aren't in Sun and Moon, and the Sinnoh and Alola Pokedexes don't have that much overlap in general (if someone has the exact breakdown of this, that would be appreciated)
Type:Null is a pretty clear reference to Arceus, and the files on its creation in the Aether labs reference the Canalave Library.
SM parallels Platinum by having you follow the main villain into another dimension at the climax of the game.
Since they would be the ""megaverse"" counterparts to the original DPPt, they would be a good place to continue the overarching multiverse plot line
They would be a good place to resolve all or some of the mysteries surrounding Looker, since he debuted in Platinum.
The 20th movie's new traveling companions have a Piplup and a Lucario; the only other non-Kanto Pokemon shown off are Ho-oh, which really doesn't count because of its role in the anime, and Marshadow and Incineroar, which market the still new-ish Gen 7.
SM's breeder classes look like DPPt's Cowgirl/Rancher classes.
Books in Burnet's Lab reference Palkia, Giratina, and Bronzong (RIP Dialga, lol)
Solgaleo and Lunala's foreheads are blue and pink respectively, and the same color scheme is used in the Team Skull battle intro.

So did I miss anything?
Edit: Forgot some frequently mentioned evidence that you guys pointed out

Event Munchlax to parallel XY's event Torchic 
Lucas didn't appear in Generations, implying that a redesign is coming soon
The Japanese Pokemon Youtube channel recently uploaded a video promoting Sinnoh starters
The connection isn't supported by very much solid evidence, but the Distortion World and Ultra Space could be linked.
Alola and Sinnoh are the only two regions to have both day and night themes.
Similarly, they are also the only two regions where the evil team admins have a unique battle theme.
Gen 7 was the first gen since Gen 4 to introduce a new evolutionary stone.

Can't find the book or toys but I definitely drew him like it. By tip I mean the last square was half black. Anyone else remember this that way?

Hi everyone, i just wanted to do some sort of challenge for myself and decided to do it based on Reddit.
I'm gonna make a team based on INDIVIDUAL pokemon commented down below.
Ofc there's a catch for me: I'll make a team based on the top 10 most upvoted comments. 
I'd also prefer if you comment bad pokemon except for unknown and magikarp.
That's it, easy as that. Comment bad pokemon that aren't magikarp or unknown and vote for other ones.

11647	"What is Zygarde doing in Terminus cave (Theory)"	"8"	"12"	"20170408"	"Gaffa_Cakes*TIN FOIL HAT INTENSIFIES*"	"At first, this question seems kinda redundant. Terminus cave is Zygarde¡¦s resting place, where it lies dormant until it is needed.
But if you think about it a little deeper, things start to not add up.
Why is Zygarde in its 50% form. It¡¦s a form that can rival Xerneas and Yveltal. So it seems a little overkill to be in that form when it¡¦s just chilling in a cave. But let¡¦s try and rationalise this.
Zygarde is only awakened when calamity strikes, right? And that¡¦s an easy question to answer.
AZ¡¦s ultimate weapon was about to be fired and all life on earth faced dire threat. So that¡¦s a good enough reason to be in its 50% form.
But why only 50%? If a global calamity is about to occur, it¡¦s a little lame to use just half of your power. And to add insult to injury, he didn¡¦t even show up.  The weapon was minutes away from being fired and Zygarde wasn¡¦t bothered to show up. Good thing the Protagonist was there to save the day or else Arceus would have fired Zygarde for sleeping on the job.
An argument I heard was ¡§Oh, Zygarde is just charging his energy to be in his most powerful form for when the moment arises. That¡¦s why he was a little late¡¨
But to counter that argument, I would like to present the most significant piece of evidence. 
Zygarde was not in Terminus cave in the first place.
What I mean is, access to Terminus cave is only given after you beat Team Flare and save the day, and Zygarde appears only after you¡¦ve beaten the Elite 4. But between beating Team Flare and beating the Elite 4, if you enter Terminus cave, Zygarde is not there.
Meaning that there was absolutely no way he could have been charging his energy to stop the weapon because the Protagonist would have seen him.
Another argument to this was ¡§He was just monitoring Kalos, because there could be another catastrophe¡¨
Balderdash, I say. If Zygarde wanted to monitor Kalos, he could have been in his core form, which gives him more cells to see through, or if he was being very cautions, his 10% form would have also been sufficient.
So what does this mean?
AZ¡¦s weapon was not a big enough threat to Zygarde, but sometime after the Protagonist beat the league, another threat came. A threat that forced Zygarde out of his slumber and made him cautiously wait in his 50% form inside Terminus Cave. 
And this threat has nothing to do with Alola or else Zygarde would have already been on the move. But it wasn¡¦t. It was just resting in its cave.
So what could this threat be?
What could possibly be a greater threat then AZ¡¦s weapon?
Well, it looks like Kalos still has a few unanswered questions¡K
And if you want  more stuff like this, then take a look at my theory about the mysterious Ghost Girls.
